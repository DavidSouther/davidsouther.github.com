  <div class="entry-content"><p>Working with git and svn is as easy as <code>git svn init ; git svn rebase ; git svn dcommit</code>. What is slightly less trivial is adding hooks to enforce certain project behavior when working with git-svn. Specifically, I want to ensure and enforce that the build (locally, at least) is successful before I push to Subversion. In this case, I don&rsquo;t have access to the Subversion server, so adding the hooks server-side is impossible. The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2014422/hooks-for-git-svn">recommended approach</a> is to use an intermediate bare repository, but that presents problems with running build scripts on the repository, since there is no working directory to build in. There is <a href="http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/PATCH-v2-git-svn-hook-before-git-svn-dcommit-td6688978.html">some discussion</a> on adding svn-dcommit hooks, but that does not look like it will be landing in git any time soon. The  solution I have is to have a repository with split heads. Most of the time, the intermediate repository will have an empty working directory. When a push happens, it will check out master, verify the build, and push to svn, before returning to the empty branch. Let&rsquo;s look at this in practice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is an open letter from me to nearly any potential client. The client and I have talked for a few emails, and I have just read an email asking me to spend 4 to 8 hours in a meeting working to detail every single piece of their software project for the next 6 months, with the expectation that in 6 months we would get back together and they will have a complete, perfect piece of software. In my reply, I try to convince them of an agile approach to development.</em></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a moment to talk about software development projects. In your email, you describe the Big Design Up Front (BDUF) approach to building projects. Everyone gets together for a meeting or two at the beginning of the project, sits down, and writes a document that describes in excruciating detail what every person in the implementation team will be doing for the rest of the project. This is necessary for buildings, for two reasons. First, it is very expensive to get half way through a project and realize that instead of a skyscraper, the owner actually needs a factory. This is even more exacerbated in software, because the medium is so abstract. Second, it is really hard to predict the future, which is what BDUF does. How can I say, &ldquo;On the 3rd of January, 2012, David will spend exactly 2 hours building form 34-A&rdquo;? We can&rsquo;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve always loved places, and in loving places, have always loved maps. I&rsquo;ve always been curious as to the relative size of places, as well. I&rsquo;m decent at estimating some things, but lengths, not so much. To get a better understanding of the comparative sizes of places around the world, I put together these pair of Google Maps, superimposed over one-another to see exactly how these sizes work. Note that because of using two maps in a Mercator projection, the sizes technically only line up when the map centers are on the same latitude.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve played through Mass Effect 3 three times now, and I will play through a couple more. The ending, by which I mean the last 10 minutes, is atrocious, as documented many places. Now, most of these inconsistencies are not huge issues in and of themselves, but taken together have a very negative impact on the experience as a whole. Even then, for all those weaknesses leading up to the (anti)climactic final decision of the series, the ending material is mostly forgivable. What cannot be forgiven are the broken promises Casey Hudson and the Bioware team have been making since <a href="http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/105/1055366p2.html">before ME2 was released.</a> &ldquo;[T]ake all of the things you&rsquo;ve done in Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 and then just let it go. Let it diverge into wildly different conclusions.&rdquo; And yet, I have had the exact same ending in three different playthroughs, across the reputation spectrum, a range of Military Strength, with wildly different decisions in ME1 and 2. The only difference? Red, Blue, or Green explosions. Why are fans let down? Bioware and Casey Hudson lied to us. Even worse than lying to us, it would not have been difficult to make the game wildly divergent, using the same assets already in the game, and minor tweaks in mechanics. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>

<h2>Side Missions</h2>

<p>The artifact gathering missions are presented very poorly. I&rsquo;m more than willing to suspend disbelief as to why Shep will run around <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/03/07">doing chores</a> for everyone in the middle of the war. The dialog overheard when getting these quests is top-notch. I really do understand why a doctor needs samples of a Cerberus poison to help a Turian general. I&rsquo;m more than happy to bring that sample back to the Citadel after Shep happens across it in a Cerberus base, and the war assets are really nice. What I am not happy about is that I have no idea where in the Hades Nexus this Obelisk of Karza is, because I happened to miss the bit of background noise as I was going shopping on the Presidium! In and of itself, not a big deal- I&rsquo;ll just go back and listen to him again, right? Since every quest giver in the history of RPGs is more than happy to repeat the same line about their missing relic over and over, right? Not this time! Would it have been terribly difficult to put an interaction circle over quest givers once you have the quest, and just make them repeat that line? It doesn&rsquo;t have to be interactive, and yes it will kill a tiny bit of the immersion listening to characters repeat themselves over and over, but Anderson does it when you talk to him on VidCon. Slightly more immersive: spend some time giving the quest givers three or four lines to cycle through. Takes time, but makes the side missions not suck.</p>

<h2>Priority: Turians and Quarians</h2>

<p>The Turian and Quarian story arcs should happen simultaneously. For a relatively guided divergent storyline in the first two games, ME3 is terribly linear. Priority mission, do sidequests, priorty mission, do all sidequests, etc, etc. There is only one way to work through the priority missions. Even doing the least possible amount of work, the &ldquo;Minimum Strength&rdquo; bar is full half way through the game. This is bullshit- if I have the minimum strength, I should be able to use it, and suffer the consequences! As with the side missions, a minor rearrangement of events would make it Divergent with a capital D, fulfilling Casey Hudsons&#8217; promise. Add the Quarians to the war counsel in the Annos Basin. It takes only another dozen or two lines of dialog, and gives the player the option of deciding whom to help first- the Turians, under attack from the Reapers, or the Quarians, in their war with the Geth. Of course, choosing one means the other is weakened when they finally join (with a little fancy arithmetic, there is a symmetric loss, so overall players aren&rsquo;t punished for choosing one over the other). Add another few lines of dialog depending on which is done first when finally starting the others&#8217; missions, and move the story forward a bit by putting the attack on the Citadel after completing one or the other of these priority missions.</p>

<h2>Priority: Asari and Salarians</h2>

<p>The Asari and Salarians feel like they were more cut than Javik. Getting full Salarian support is stupidly hard, and essentially requires Sheperd stabbing one of his closes allies, not to mention the entire Krogan race, in the back. Yet, there&rsquo;s a perfect alternative: Salarians are already at odds within their government. Add a small side-mission after the Cerberus attack on the Citadel, made much easier if the Salarian counselor survived the attack, working with an STG group somewhere in the galaxy. Completing that mission will add several Salarian war assets, piss off the Delatross a bit, but overall gaining Salarian popular support. With the Asari, the attack on Thessia should start earlier, ideally offered during the aftermath of the Cerberus attack. Shep of course still gets to choose what order to tackle things in, but having more Priority missions active at any one time would, I think, increase the narrative tension in the game. The player needs to decide the right balance between pushing forward with the assault on Earth, knowing the fleets are not at their full potential, while simultaneously knowing that the longer it takes to bring a fleet into the war, the weaker that fleet is. In this scenario, in the middle game Shep will have a timed mission to complete (Tuchanka: Bomb, Grissom Academy, and maybe one more), one or two N7 missions to tie in to the multiplayer, and three priority missions (Sur&#8217;Kesh/Tuchanka OR Rannoch, Sur&#8217;Kesh 2, and Thessia/Horizon/Cerberus) to choose from. Starting Cerberus can start the end game just as it does now, with the possibility of assaulting Earth with a very weak fleet.</p>

<h2>Priority: Earth</h2>

<p>The majority of the Earth mission needs just a touch more work, and mostly from the CGI Video department. While the text blurbs about the different assets add tremendous wealth and texture to the narrative, actually seeing some of those units in play would be worth every dollar put in to their creation. To this end, the initial &ldquo;Checking In&rdquo; shots are not enough. Each of the major assets (the race&rsquo;s fleets, eg all the top-level war asset categories) should have a unique role to play in the battle for Earth. This is the climax of the entire series. It needs the most thought of all the parts of this franchise. Spend time to sketch out exactly, in all the details, what would happen in this battle. The Sword fleet and Hammer force approach through the Charon relay. The Reapers take position around Earth, between the Allied fleets and the Citadel. The Allied fleets fire the opening volleys (highlighting Alliance, Turian and Asari dreadnaughts), limiting their fire to conservative targeting solutions, not wanting to hit Earth. As the distance closes, the fighter units join combat. When the Reapers are appropriately engaged with broadside fleet operations, and the fighters have set up an appropriate screen, Hammer slips through to land in London. So far, no changes from what&rsquo;s actually shown on screen. Now, with support from the various special ops war assets, we could have a few 5 or 10 second shots of these different groups in action on Earth. About half way through the mission (when Shep reaches the Forward Operations Base), we get another couple of special CGI scenes. If the fleets have the support of the Geth, Quarians, or Salarians, those fleets can be shown providing relief for Sword (call them Shield). If not&hellip; well, we see more Sword ships getting demolished by the Reapers.</p>

<p>Part two, the push to the conduit, again plays out as it is now. We have a final change, though- when Harbinger breaks off, if Shep has a second fleet in Shield, that fleet breaks off and harasses Harbinger enough to let Shep get to the Citadel without that obnoxious laser. If Shep doesn&rsquo;t have that asset, Harbinger beats Shep to the Conduit, shoots Shep, and proceeds to destroy the fleets in Earth orbit. Yes, if a player chooses to have a Shep with this few assets, the Reapers should win. If there were two fleets in Shield, Harbinger ties Shep to the Conduit, kills Shep still, but Anderson manages to get through. Anderson sets off the Crucible, destroys the Reapers, but the Galaxy is left in shambles. If Shep has enough assets, Shield slows Harbinger enough to give Shep time to make it to the Citadel. This time, Shep meets The Illusive Man, and the player is given one last choice: Destroy or Control. Not in a red/blue explosion way, but TIM has spent time studying the Crucible in ways the Allied scientists would not, and has a plausible reason for how to re-purpose the Crucible&rsquo;s output. Shep then chooses- destroy the Reapers, uniting the galactic races, or use the Reapers to destroy the other races, ensuring Human dominance. Four endings, one possible choice, and each is dictated by how the player has gotten assets through the first games with any final choices here. Finally, we earn a 5 minute cut scene wrapping up all our choices. Remember how Fallout 3 has the montage of 10 or 20 second clips of all the people The Vault Dweller runs into? Same thing, 10 &ndash; 20 second clips for a reasonable number of important plot points throughout the first few games. One longer video for the Reapers winning, then one or two for the major Allied races who survived, and two or three for each squad mate who survived, depending on how they interacted with Shep through the series.</p>

<h2>Reaper Motives</h2>

<p>The Star Child is stupid. The Star Child is completely unnecessary. The Star Child&rsquo;s dialog and writing are worse than the trash that made it into Mass Effect: Deception. Really, Bioware could have done almost anything with the Reapers&#8217; motives, and had a better ending. I see two obvious choices. Have the Reapers truly be a Lovecraftian horror. Humanity is nothing in the galaxy. Not only is Humanity nothing in the galaxy, literally all Humanity&rsquo;s companions are nothing. Harbinger can continue the line that Sovereign starts: the Reapers are unknowable, incomprehensible, and utterly powerful. For that to work, however, the Reapers must win, and will if Shep can&rsquo;t rally enough forces. Otherwise, come to the realization that ascension for other species is reproduction for the Reapers. The Reapers come through every cycle and harvest the current best DNA to create new Reapers. This cycle business is another form of Natural Selection, well within the confines of today&rsquo;s science mixed with the sci-fi of Mass Effect. Why, then, would Sovereign and Harbinger tell Shep the Reapers are incomprehensible? They&rsquo;re arrogant sons of bitches, and Shep&rsquo;s just put a boot in their face to prove them wrong. In the ending scenarios I described above, have a final conversation between Harbinger and Shep at one of two points- either in person, in the endings where Shep dies, of Harbinger gloating, or via hologram when Shep&rsquo;s on the Citadel, of Shep gloating, when Shep wins. The series is so profound in its presentation of a myriad of philosophical issues, with Cosmicism in nearly everyone&rsquo;s mind since the first sight of Sovereign on Eden Prime. Embrace that!</p>

<h2>The End</h2>

<p>Yes, we will see DLC. I would love an Aria/Omega DLC, adding a mission to route Cerberus from the Anti-Citadel. I would pay for that DLC, and a myriad of other stories from this universe. There is so much potential in this Galaxy at War, and I do not begrudge Bioware and their evil overlords, EA, the desire to charge for more content. What I do have a problem with is how horribly Casey Hudson and Bioware mishandled this climax of the greatest Sci Fi story to appear in a video game. I begrudge the fact that we, the fans, were lied to, repeatedly. The ending that shipped with Mass Effect 3 was not wildly divergent. The story of ME3 was not particularly divergent. Each small arc did an excellent job at closing all the stories we, the fans, have grown to love and cherish. Why, then, were we told Sheperd&rsquo;s arc wasn&rsquo;t important enough for that same closing?</p>

<h2>Addendum</h2>
