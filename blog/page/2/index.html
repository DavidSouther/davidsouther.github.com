  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cold day or hot, nothing quite says tasty like a bowl of home-made chili. Probably the easiest dish to take and make your own, so many easy things go into the flavors of a pot of easy chili, you can&rsquo;t help but not experiment with this recipe!</p>

<ul>
<li>&frac12; lbs ground beef</li>
<li>1 12oz can salsa (your choice, determines spicy level)</li>
<li>1 8oz can refried beans</li>
<li>1 12oz bottle beer (your choice, determines secondary flavors)</li>
<li>Olive Oil</li>
</ul>


<p>This recipe goes easy by trusting the brewer and salsa-er (one who makes salsa?) for the flavors in the chili. With that in mind, choose your favorite salsa and a beer you think would go with that salsa, and start your burners!</p>

<p>Brown the beef. Put a bit of oil in the pan, let it get nice and hot, add the beef, stir until well cooked. Seriously, don&rsquo;t fuck around with ground beef, cook it all the way through.</p>

<p>Add salsa the refried beans. Stir, let beans melt.</p>

<p>Add beer, more beer for thinner, less for thicker. Let simmer, while drinking second beer. Stir occasionally. Simmer at least 10 minutes, longer for more flavor but less stock.</p>

<p>Wipe off counter, serve with beer! You&rsquo;ll be delighted how well the</p>

<h3>Alternatives:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p> Cube cheddar and mozzarella cheese, and replace for beer. Stir <em>constantly</em>, but only until heated. Serve with chips (and beer). Cubing the cheeses into &frac14; inch chunks is important, otherwise they melt weird and you get a really odd texture. Don&rsquo;t use shredded cheese.</p></li>
<li><p> Different salsas, different beers. For the true chef, cook your own salsa and brew your own beer. Brewing is not Lazy-Ass Gourmet, and I don&rsquo;t brew myself, but it is a noble hobby.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The art of cooking Fast, Cheap, Clean</h3>

<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you cooking for yourself? Do you think it&rsquo;s too expensive? Do you think you don&rsquo;t know how to cook? Or do you just think you don&rsquo;t have enough time in the day? If any of those are your excuse, you&rsquo;re about to lose them. Cooking great food isn&rsquo;t that difficult once you have a few basic dishes, and with the right recipes, you can be cooking great dinners for yourself or your family in half an hour. This is lazy-ass gourmet, and we&rsquo;re going to cook the most fantastic meals in no time at all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a busy guy, but man, I love to cook. I&rsquo;ve yet to find a restaurant that can consistently satisfy me with their cooking more than I can do on my own. My secret is finding recipes, and ways to cook those recipes, that take as long to cook as it takes me to watch an episode of the Daily Show (then I watch Colbert while I eat!). Here at lazy-ass gourmet, I&rsquo;ll share a bunch of these recipes, and ways to cook them so that we have a wide combination of things to do with our dishes that we&rsquo;ll always have great food at home, and never get bored with what we&rsquo;re eating.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.brokeassgourmet.com">Broke-ass Gourmet</a> (I absolutely recommend her recipes, they are fantastic), but you&rsquo;ll find that while the ingredients for a meal are about the same as a plate would be if you went out, you&rsquo;ll several plates worth, and it will definitely come out much cheaper in the long run. The ingredients I recommend are a step up from college dorm food, but you can have fun shopping around for the best prices on what you find are your favorite things. On the other hand, this isn&rsquo;t Iron Chef. I don&rsquo;t use that many ingredients, I just play with what I have in slightly different ways.</p>

<p>There are a lot of techniques in cooking. It takes some time to get comfortable with a knife. There are a lot of spices and flavors to discover and find out how they work together. These all take your time and experimentation, and frankly half the fun of cooking is trying new things, especially when they go wrong! These are things you really can&rsquo;t learn in a book (though you can make good headway), but just have to try on your own.</p>

<p>There is one thing, however, that I can tell you in the spirit of Lazy-Ass Gourmet. Clean up immediately. As in, before you go on to the next step, wipe off your utensils you just used and the surface you just used. It takes 10 seconds, but saves so much time from the daunting task of cleaning everything at once after you&rsquo;ve cooked. Also, do things that make it easier to keep clean. When you&rsquo;re chopping and peeling onions, keep the trash can right there for the peelings. When you&rsquo;re working at the stove, put a splash guard over your pan and a lid on your pots. These little things make it a hundred times easier to keep your kitchen clean, and yourself happy and lazy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nothing says good eating like a steaming plate of steaks, mashed potatoes, and country veggies. The best part? It&rsquo;s one of the easiest things you can cook. Follow along, and in half an hour you&rsquo;ll be having better steaks than they server at Morton&rsquo;s.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 to 4 Fillets, 1-2&#8221; thick.</li>
<li>1 can whole kernel corn</li>
<li>1 can sliced carrots</li>
<li>1 can french-cut green beans</li>
<li>1 white onion</li>
<li>4-6 red potatoes</li>
<li>2 tblsp butter</li>
<li>&frac14; quart half-and-half</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Lawry&rsquo;s</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>


<p>Quarter the potatoes. We&rsquo;re doing mashed potatoes, so go fast and dirty here. Find the longest, thinnest part of the potato, cut in half, find the next thinnest side, cut in half, then cut the last side two or three times. At this point you&rsquo;ll have &lt;1&#8221; cubes of potato. Put those potatoes &amp; some salt in pot. Add water to ~1&#8221; above the potatoes. Add a dash (~1 teaspoon) of oil (this stops the water from boiling over. Place the pot over high heat.</p>

<p>Chop the onion. Start by cutting off the ends. I like larger chunks of onion, so I usually slice once through the thickest part of the onion, once through each half, then slice one of the quarters the long way and the other quarter radially. That gives a good combination of fat slices and long slices. Pour a couple dashes of oil into pan (not too much, just enough to start searing the onion). Bring oil to temperature. Over high heat this should take less than a minute; you&rsquo;ll know its ready when the oil starts to have rivulets when it flows over itself. Add the onions, stirring regularly until the onions are lightly cooked. Add some Lawry&rsquo;s. Clear out an area of the pan moving the onions to the side. Add steaks in the clearing, let them cook for about a minute, dash the uncooked side  with Lawry&rsquo;s, turn them over. Drain veggies from the can. Add veggies to the pan, add Lawry&rsquo;s to taste, stir, and cover. Wait about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

<p>When potatoes are done (easily pierced by fork), drain in colander and put back in pot. Rinse colander and place on drying rack. Add butter, half-and- half, and salt to potatoes. Mash. This makes the consistency I like; for thicker use more potatoes or less half-and-half; for thinner use less potatoes or thinner milk (whole, skim).</p>

<p>Steaks will take about 5 minutes / level: 5 minutes rare, 10 minutes medium rare, 15 minutes medium well, 20 minutes well done. Test by cutting open; after a few times, you&rsquo;ll get a feel for your stove and know when they&rsquo;re done without needing to check.</p>

<p>Wipe off counter, serve, &amp; enjoy!</p>

<h3>Alternatives:</h3>

<ol>
<li> Add clove, then onion.</li>
<li> Use fresh veggies (adds ~5 minutes to dice).</li>
<li> Use different meat: different steak cuts, pork, chicken, etc.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Client-side form validation is a cross-cutting concern helping users get the most correct data into a form as quickly as possible. Good form validation will tell users what fields are most important in your form and exactly what is expected of their input. Form validation is not concerned with guaranteeing correct data gets sent from the user agent to the service backing the form &mdash; the service should define its own data ingestion and validation concerns. This discussion is only concerned with client-side form validation and helping users input acceptable data.</p>

<p>In this view, the form itself is an entire application, independent of any other piece of software. The form, rendered in the browser DOM, provides visual elements for a user to provide input. As the user provides input, the form will indicate whether that data is correct, perhaps by highlighting the field in green, or provide warnings that the data is invalid, perhaps by highlighting the field in red and displaying a light-weight pop-up with a polite message describing what, exactly, is wrong with the input. When the user tells the form to submit data, the form can decide if the input is appropriate, and if so pass that data on to some other service. Generally, this will be an HTTP POST, but could occur as a full page redirect or an AJAX request. In a more exotic workflow, the form could aggregate the input and generate an event to some other element, or publish a message to a web-worker.</p>

<p>To achieve this view of form validation, a single library must meet a variety of concerns.</p>

<h2>Semantic</h2>

<p>Validation markup should describe the expected data as fully as possible. Semantic descriptions of data should be as consistent as possible, ensuring a consistent and quality experience across the forms on the domain.</p>

<p>  ### HTML5 Native</p>

<p>The HTML5 specification provides a wealth of expressive form and validation features. HTML4 forms not served as strict XHTML are able to access these attributes programmatically. Any implementation should at least look to the design decisions made by the HTML5 working group.</p>

<p>  ### Settings in markup</p>

<p>Any validation settings, including rules and error behavior, should be described as close to the input field as possible, preferably as an attribute directly. Localization and internationalization may require settings stored in alternative locations, in which case the l10n and i18n keys should be as close to the element as possible.</p>

<p>  ### Error markup</p>

<p>The markup rendering errors and notifications should have semantic descriptions, probably achieved with specific classes. Browser support for pseudo-selectors would also be an excellent hook for designers to use.</p>

<p>  ### Form &amp; field</p>

<p>Validation rules will apply both to input fields individually, as well as to groups of input fields and forms as a whole. The library needs a mechanism to support business logic at any level of field aggregation. For instance, a form may need to ask for multiple email addresses. A component could be built around a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and adding <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;input type="email" name="to[]" class="distinct" /&gt;</code> for every new email address the user wishes to add. Each input must contain a valid email address, and the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> as a whole should guarantee that each address in the <code>to[]</code> array is unique.</p>

<h2>Aspect</h2>

<p>Form validation is a cross-cutting concern. Form code should not need to take any actions beyond describing the validation rules (in as little code as possible). The validation tools should apply without further intervention to any form and form element available.</p>

<p>  ### Applies with no intervention</p>

<p>Including the code on a page should be the most intervention necessary by client code. If the validation library is part of the browser itself, purely semantic html/css forms will work with no developer intervention (though library extensions may still be necessary to bridge incompatible or incomplete implementations).</p>

<p>  ### Hooks to sensible events</p>

<p>There are places where forms&#8217; business logic will need additional or non-standard logic given its data descriptions. While the validation library should attach to forms automatically, it should also provide appropriate events and hooks for forms to extend additional behaviors. Further, some forms libraries may attempt to make disparate user agents behave consistently; in this case, the library must provide a common event interface across implementations.</p>

<h2>Non-invasive</h2>

<p>As validation logic gets applied cross-cuttingly, it is imperative the library not cause render, layout, page-reflow, and other errors.</p>

<p>  ### Doesn&rsquo;t change page flow</p>

<p>Under no circumstances can the validation library cause a page reflow under normal CSS conditions. Any elements added to the page must be given a default style removing them from page flow. Any classes added should be well-described, and chosen to minimize the chance of conflicting with other common class names.</p>

<pre><code>### Float with arrow
</code></pre>

<p>HTML5 browsers have independently adopted the convention of a floating div with an arrow pointing at the input element.</p>

<p>  ### Doesn&rsquo;t interupt the user</p>

<p>Validation should not occur while the user is actively providing input. In particular, if an element has focus validation should wait until absolutely certain the user is done inputting data to display validation errors. In a similar vein, if a user is rapidly jumping between fields, validation should not display errors in a way allowing users to miss the prompts.</p>

<p>  ### Page data must remain visible</p>

<p>Validation error messages should not cover page content, unless the validation message explicitly replaces that information.</p>

<h2>Extensible</h2>

<p>Forms will need to have business logic that does not fit in the default configuration of any particular validation library. The default error messages may not correctly describe the validation concern with the form.</p>

<p>  ### Add, override validator functions</p>

<p>Some validation functions may be incorrect. Forms may wish to constrain a URL to only accept <code>ftp:</code> connections. Emails may want to restrict to a certain mail domain. In any of these cases, the form will need to either add additional rules, or override the default rules.</p>

<p>  ### Configure errors</p>

<p>The default errors will not describe every error of some class. A form may wish to tell a user that not only is the email invalid, it must be in a certain domain.</p>

<p>  ### Markup, messages, settings</p>

<p>Form designers demand as much control as possible. Business analysts will want to tweak and localize error messages. Developers will need to edit some default settings at some point. These should all be trivially easy to override piecemeal, as needed.</p>

<h2>Current solutions</h2>

<p>There are several libraries and tools today meeting some of these concerns.</p>

<h3>HTML5 Form Validation</h3>

<p>HTML5 has a variety of validation features in place and implemented by the newer browsers. The specification covers what is likely to be 90% of the validation criteria in a fully standards compliant way (no more need to implement a grammar recognizing RFCs 5321 and 5322). Any additional rules can be added by a javascript library, focused on adding only the small subset of features a particular forms application needs.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/forward-thinking-form-validation/">Usage</a></em></p>

<p>This article from A List Apart is a fantastic discussion of ways to control validation using almost purely CSS.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/ryanseddon/H5F">Shim</a></em></p>

<p>A shim for HTML4 browsers adding most of the utilities now provided by HTML5 browsers. Has some flaws:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Doesn&rsquo;t fall back on native implementation</p></li>
<li><p>Pseudo-selectors don&rsquo;t work for CSS2.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another article, with some intriguing uses of <code>title</code> and <code>x-moz-errormessage</code> attributes.</p>

<h3>jQuery plugin</h3>

<p>The bassistance jQuery plugin has become the de-facto standard jQuery validation library. It provides nearly every feature and meets all the concerns mentioned here, though is not as strictly focused as a pure HTML5 solution might be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a> is a fantastic tool, something that nearly every javascript project will probably want to pull in at some point. Underscore is the collections framework for Javascript. It does all the collectiony things, in a functional way, very quickly and efficiently. There are still a couple other every-day things that JS libraries need, that don&rsquo;t quite touch the DOM, making jQuery a bit too heavy. To that end, I&rsquo;ve put those features in a library called Superscore, a few additions to the underscore library. Many of these stand on their own, but since you should already be using underscore, it makes sense to namespace them there.</p>

<p>The project is available on <a href="https://github.com/DavidSouther/superscore">github</a>, along with all the <a href="http://davidsouther.github.com/superscore/">documentation</a>. Take a look and see if there&rsquo;s a place for it in your projects!</p>
