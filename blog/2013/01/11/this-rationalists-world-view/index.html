<div class="entry-content"><p>The myriad parameters to support human life are nearly all emergent.</p>

<p>Look out in the night sky. How many stars do you see? (In the suburbs, maybe 2000). How many of those are actually galaxies? About a dozen. How many planets can you see? 5. How many stars do our telescopes see, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stars%20in%20the%20milky%20way&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=stars%20in%20the%20&amp;aqs=chrome.0.59j0j57j5j61j60.2058&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">in the Milky Way</a>? 300 billion. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=galaxies%20in%20the%20universe&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=Galaxies%20in%20the%20uni&amp;aqs=chrome.2.57j5j0l2j62l2.2777&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Galaxies</a>? 170 billion. Planets? Nearly 1000 confirmed (ok, only a dozen or so extra solar have been directly imaged) and another 2,000 awaiting data analysis, and we are literally just getting started. The latest analysis estimates 100 billion planets in the milky way (one every three stars, but more like 3 &ndash; 5 every 10 stars, given the way planetary systems form). 17 billion or so of those are <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/01/07/alien_earths_new_study_indicates_there_are_billions_of_earth_sized_planets.html">probably Earth-like</a> (rocky, with masses between Mars and ~1.5x Earth).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>How many of those 17 billion orbit their star at a distance which would have surface temperatures between -10 and 110c? (Water freezing to boiling, because water does some really neat phase shifts in those ranges that make possible quite a bit of really interesting chemistry.) Probably quite a few. Let&rsquo;s be conservative, and say 7 billion. We&rsquo;re not considering moons, asteroids, extreme environments, or any exotic chemistry, just worlds where chemistry would behave about the way it&rsquo;s presented in undergrad classes. That&rsquo;s one planet potentially capable of harboring chemical reactions that we see in living organisms for every human being alive today. In one of a hundred billion galaxies. Think about that for a moment.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s think about that organic chemistry for a moment. We don&rsquo;t really know how, exactly, life got started. We&rsquo;ve got quite a few great experiments, but they depend on a bit of speculation of the Earth&rsquo;s environment over 3 billion years ago, so they are no where near &ldquo;theorum&rdquo; yet. (Thank you, Richard Dawkins, for that phrase.) There were some great experiments in the 70s that mixed water, basic chemicals (amonias and some carbon dioxide and whatnot), added sparks, and got amino acids. Pretty cool, but not life.</p>

<p>What do we need to have life? I&rsquo;m going with: (1) self-replicating and (2) produces energy. You can have one without the other, but you&rsquo;ll probably need both to meet the basic criteria for life. RNA as a molecule works surprisingly well, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RYSKKS/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title">because it can self replicate</a>, and with a couple other enzymes can start producing energy. Again, not sure on all the details, but the broad strokes are plausible with today&rsquo;s understanding of chemistry. Once you have a self-replicating bit of life (a cynaobacteria, on Earth), the very well understood mechanisms of evolution kick in.</p>

<p>Specifically, those are genetic recombination and natural selection. Genetic recombination creates viable varieties of living organisms, and natural selection culls those which are most suited to their (changing) environment. Over 3 and a half billion years, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LVVCQM/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title">those two forces end up creating a species</a> capable of reasoning about its environment, of building telescopes that pick up light emitted 13.4 billion years ago, and deducing very accurately that the universe in which it lives is 13.75 billion years ago, and &ldquo;flat&rdquo; in the terminology of what many consider its greatest scientist.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s how you get from a rock in space to sentience. How did you get that rock? The rock is made of elements that were fused together in shells of an exploding star. Stars the mass of our sun spend all their lives fusing single protons into light Helium. Stars a bit larger than the sun, however, have enough gravity and energy to smash that Helium-3 into Helium-4, and then (this is the fun part), that Helium-4 with more He and H to get Carbon-12. Once you have Carbon-12, it fuses to make Nitrogen, then more Carbon (13), then some Oxygen, a bit more Nitrogen, before fissing back to Carbon-12. If you turn around and look at those chemical processes in the second paragraph here, you notice a lot of, you guessed it, Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. Other (heavier) stars break <em>way</em> out of that cycle, burning Carbon into Neon into Silicon eventually into Nickle and Zinc (which decay back to Iron), before blowing up. In even heavier stars, they blow up so violently that so many neutrons get thrown around that that iron very quickly gets fused all the way up the chain of atomic elements until you get Uranium and other heavy stuff with names of universities attached to them.</p>

<p>All that, from three basic concepts: Some gravity, a bit of nuclear fusion, a touch of organic chemistry (electromagnetism), and the simple mechanisms of evolution. All that variety and beauty and wonder in the universe, emerging from a few basic processes.</p>

<p>How does it get started? We&rsquo;re really not 100% sure, but quantum mechanics has some answers. I&rsquo;m not as familiar with the material, so this one is going to be very short: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T4KQJS/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title">Laurence Krauss</a> describes some theories in quantum vacuum fluctuations that could give rise to new universes. This is not quack science, these are discussions of theories and results of data being gathered at the LHC and other colliders today. (Don&rsquo;t take that as me saying we&rsquo;ll have answers tomorrow, just saying we can confidently say we&rsquo;re probably asking the right questions.)</p>

<p>So, what does this all mean? I take it to mean this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> There is a natural world.</p></li>
<li><p> That natural world is consistent.</p></li>
<li><p> We are a part of the natural world.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There is a notion in physics (and science) called the anthropic principle. Naively, it says &ldquo;The universe must be this way because we are in a universe.&rdquo; More subtly, it says there are a myriad of potential, possible, or conceivable universes, and we happen to be in one arranged in such a way we can observe and reason about it. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s a sanity check on theories in the avant garde of physics. On the other, it is the basis for a worldview that recognizes the grandiosity of the universe, but depends on a rational exploration of that universe.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not easy being a rationalist, but it&rsquo;s taught us a tremendous deal about the world we live in. From a pragmatic policy point, if you truly believe Earth was created 10,000 years ago in 6 literal days (as some US senators have indicated they do), we must immediately disarm all nuclear warheads, because we haven&rsquo;t got a damned clue how they work, and they could mystically detonate at any moment.</p>

<p>Back to the theology, we know enough about the universe that there is no need to invoke a god, or religion, to explain any aspect of life. There is no evidence for a soul or afterlife, you will neither be reincarnated nor go to heaven (or hell). There is no need for a violent deity who demands homage and the destruction of a tribe&rsquo;s enemy, nor is there a need for a loving deity to provide a reason to be compassionate to your fellow H. sapien, fellow animal, or the environment around you.</p>

<p>Does my worldview have faith? No. I have something much stronger than faith: evidence and reason.</p>

<p>Evidence and reason are the birthright of the enlightenment. This tradition has improved society in innumerable ways, but chief among them is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052REUW0/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title">drastic plunge in violence</a> rates throughout the world (roughly commensurate to the level of accepting enlightenment philosophy into their societies).</p>
