<div class="entry-content"><h3>Dichotomy in modern tragedy</h3>

<p>Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <em>Frankenstein</em> and William Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Hamlet</em> are two revenge stories which present a twist on classic Aristotelian tragedy. The dichotomy in the titular characters&#8217; tragic flights, one based on faith, the other on logic, especially emphasize that choices, not fate, which rule the modern tragic protagonist.</p>

<p>Frankenstein&rsquo;s fall, and need for revenge, is seated firmly in his scientific reasoning. Natural science (where Alchemy may be called that) led Victor to animate his first creature. When confronted with the decision of animating a second creature, Victor&#8217; logic leads him to choose the proven needs of the many over the possible wants of the few.</p>

<p>Hamlet, on the other hand, focuses his logic entirely on faith and intuition. Without faith in the ghost, there would be no cause for undue suspicion against Claudius; without that suspicion, there would be no catalyst for the mousetrap play, the ranting madness, or the long spoken personal essays looking into himself. The distance between the two calls for revenge is immense, though both are grounded in the logic of what each character believes (after much consideration) to be the truth.</p>

<p>William Shakespeare and Mary Shelly come at their works from very different angles. Shakespeare spent the autumn and winter of 1599 revising and putting new lines to a story that had already been in circulation for some 500 years, updating it to his times. One prominent aspect of his new take on the classic tale of revenge was the ghost of Hamlet&rsquo;s father. In all previous versions of the play, Claudius&#8217; betrayal was well known, and the folk hero Hamlet takes his vengeance for vengeance&#8217; sake. Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet, however, is faced with a ghost representative of one of the great issues of Shakespeare&rsquo;s era: the tension between England&rsquo;s Catholic and Protestant churches. This adds an entirely new dimension to the character, and the basis for Hamlet&rsquo;s moral dilemma. In the first act, we hear the ghost comes from &ldquo;sulph&#8217;rous and tormenting flames,&rdquo; a specter calling to &ldquo;revenge his foul and most unnatural mur[d]er&rdquo; (Act I, Scene V). Hamlet must decide whether to trust this ghost (who might well be a protestant demon in a catholic disguise) or not, prompting him to stage the mousetrap play.</p>

<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, the continual advances in science and mathematics led Shelley to pen a truly original work that captured the tremendous upheavals brought about by the scientific revolution of the time. Even so, the work of a scientist in her time was still often conducted by rich gentleman born into wealth playing with a hobby picked up in grammar school. Shelly continues this pattern with Victor, a rich boy whose &ldquo;ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics&rdquo; (Chapter 1, Paragraph 1). He is a man who attempts to find a solid, conclusive proof for every action and decision he makes, fascinated by &ldquo;the theory which to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates&rdquo; (Chapter 2, Paragraph 6). Strong contemporary influences on both authors provide the grounding each has for their stories of tragedy.</p>

<p>Hamlet&rsquo;s journey into the recesses of his psyche is Shakespeare&rsquo;s breath of life into a beaten and overused plot, and the use of soliloquy, which closely follows the form of the personal essay, allowed Shakespeare to redefine the face of tragedy. What was for Aristotle a &ldquo;tragic flaw&rdquo; became a conduit for questions of the &lsquo;whys&rsquo; in faith, honor, and duty, exemplified in the third act: &ldquo;Whether &lsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer/The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune/Or to take arms against a sea of troubles&rdquo; (Act III, Scene I). While this is indeed Hamlet&rsquo;s tragic flaw (he wouldn&rsquo;t be dead if he had just killed Claudius at prayer), it changed the focus of the drama onto the reasons for his choices, rather than his predestined fate.</p>

<p>In Frankenstein, Victor&rsquo;s single-minded pursuit of knowledge leads to the creation of the monster. Victor&rsquo;s flaw is his irresponsibility: &ldquo;Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan&rdquo; (Chapter 4, Paragraph 7). Had he taken the time to consider his actions, and proceed with both caution and help from a fellow at the university, it is very possible that the monster&rsquo;s fall into savagery could have been avoided. The tragedy is proved more poignant by Shelley&rsquo;s use of Point of View. By switching from one storyteller to another, and then often telling yet another character&rsquo;s story, the point-of-view is only compounded by the additional texts, epistles, and so forth, presenting literally every passage in first person &ndash; while maintaining six separate Storytellers.</p>

<p>There are specific passages in each story that clearly show the titular characters&#8217; motives and reasons. In Hamlet, act III again illuminates his values and intentions. After the mousetrap play, Hamlet finds Claudius praying in the chapel. &ldquo;Now I could do it pat, now he is praying&rdquo; has Hamlet with his sword poised to strike. His next thought stops him cold- &ldquo;And now he would go to heavens.&rdquo; (Act III, Scene III). Faith in heaven and god above stop Hamlet&rsquo;s easy kill; to do so now would negate his revenge and leave Hamlet in a worse position than he was before. Hamlet is, through his faith, forced to wait for a more opportune time; his downfall in the making, as there comes no better time.</p>

<p>Frankenstein makes a similar decision in the beginning of Chapter 20. All his logic and reasoning boil down to one thought, shaping his goals and motives for the rest of the novel. [&hellip;] one of the first results of those sympathies for which the demon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the Earth&#8221; (Chapter 20, Paragraph 1). At this crux, Victor knows the monster will not be amused with his decision, and will as promised seek out to destroy Victor and his family. Yet still, his logic proves that good will prevail, and the monster will die bearing no progeny. Another interesting influence on both leads is their relationships with their families, and their insistence on secrecy in their designs. Neither Hamlet nor Frankenstein are comfortable in revealing their actions; Hamlet forces (with the Ghost&rsquo;s help) Marcellus and Horatio to &ldquo;Swear&rdquo; they &ldquo;never shall, to note that you know aught of me&rdquo; (Act l, Scene V). Victor, with no witnesses, makes the same promise to himself: &ldquo;I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dreams are significant to both men, as is their symbolism of death and suicide. &ldquo;To die- to sleep. / To sleep- perchance to dream&rdquo; (Act Scene I) says Hamlet, speaking for both. &ldquo;My dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me&rdquo; (Chapter 21, Paragraph 35) finishes Victor. Suicide is an easy option, a way to cheat the fate Aristotle demands of their tragedies. Yet, where would that leave their goals? Both seem to think broken and dashed- &ldquo;For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, When he himself might his quietus make/ With a bare bodkin? But that the dread of something after death- The undiscover&rsquo;d country, puzzles the will&rdquo; (Act Ill, Scene I). When asked if he was alright, Victor replies &ldquo;if indeed I did not dream, am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror&rdquo; (Chapter 21, Paragraph 12).</p>

<p>Yet again, both are seen through by their guiding forces. Victor, having heard the monster&rsquo;s promise, sets himself to destroy the foul creature on the promised night. With the aid of guards, arms, and his love shared with Elizabeth, only a slight miscalculation on his part sees the monster through, shatters Victor, and finally drives home the determination Victor must have in his endeavor. Hamlet&rsquo;s faith, also, sees him through. While thinking of an easy solution for himself, &ldquo;thus conscience does make cowards of us all, / [&hellip;] / And lose the name of action&rdquo; (Act III Scene I). His faith in his father, the ghost, and himself are too strong, support Hamlet&rsquo;s revenge, mask in his madness and revel in his machinations.</p>

<p>The tragedies see both men to the end of their revenge, but for both, a bittersweet ending. Hamlet&rsquo;s father is avenged. Victor&rsquo;s monster is destroyed. Hamlet is destroyed not by his faith, which saw him through, but by his trust in the gentleman&rsquo;s sport. Victor gives in to true madness, ignoring reason that the monster has fulfilled its desires, and wishes only to be left alone. Had both ended their journeys earlier, at a point where they may not have achieved all their goals, but would put an end to their problems, either character could have averted their drama from tragedy and lived with his companions to another adventure. It is not a single character flaw that defines these tragedies, or a predefined fate that we must see lived out. Shakespeare and Shelley both have characters who act for themselves, and taking their destinies in their own hands have plans that backfire, destroy them not through hubris or purpose, but through subtle points, missed connotations, and double entendres.</p>
