    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All domestic policies will be for nothing if <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/world/middleeast/report-on-iran-nuclear-work-puts-israel-in-a-box.html">Israel starts a war with Iran</a>.</p>

<p>The Economy is on everyone&rsquo;s mind, but the economy&rsquo;s not going to change overnight (so says Ryan, and I can agree on that point). The Environment is in serious danger of long-term damage that will make it materially more difficult for us as a species to prosper. Our Education system has many calling for a complete overhaul, but that will take years before our best and brightest children are able to make positive changes from such changes.</p>

<p>These are all long-term issues which are critical to building a bright future, and require serious thought in the mid-term.</p>

<p>These will be for nothing if Israel attacks Iran.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Israel&rsquo;s sabre-rattling over the past decade has convinced Iran of the need for nuclear weapons to act as a deterrent in defending their sovereign self-interests. US-Israeli espionage has been wildly successful in tempering and mitigating this threat in the short-term, but Iran was never playing a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get nukes fast&rdquo; game. They saw what happened to the Hussein regime, and are smart enough to not fall into that trap.</p>

<p>So now, we have an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19424097">Iran with full scale uranium enrichment facilities</a>, built into a hardened bunker that only the United States has the technological capability to pose a feasible threat.</p>

<p>We have an Israel that has repeatedly demonstrated they are more than willing to prefer force to diplomacy.</p>

<p>The Israeli leadership has every intention of launching a unilateral military strike against the sovereign Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Israeli leadership full expects the United States to provide unconditional military support if it takes such actions. Such an attack would be the worst possible action to take against Iran. Iran is currently experiencing political turmoil inside its borders; attacking now would provide solidarity around the Ahmadinejad regime. Iran has already moved its nuclear production underground; <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/03/120903fa_fact_remnick">attacking now would prove to Iran how necessary those plans truly were</a>.</p>

<p>Domestically, we have a sitting president who has a checkered record of handling situations in the middle east, though many observers and commentators on the world scene tend to credit President Obama with having learned from his earlier mistakes, and <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/16/how-obama-s-middle-east-policy-has-worked.html">think he&rsquo;s doing much better now than at the beginning of his presidency</a>. He is surrounded by advisers who argue against conflict, and supported by a base who also oppose those conflicts.</p>

<p>Mr. Romney&rsquo;s foreign policy is guided by an <a href="http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/26/romney-russia-is-our-number-one-geopolitical-foe/">archaic view of Russia as a credible military threat</a>, who begs financial support from the most wealthy and powerful of the Israeli right-wing, and has hinted he agrees with the assessment of Iran as a religious threat. He is surrounded by supporters who call for direct support of Israel in such a conflict with Iran, and who do not see diplomacy as a viable option.</p>

<p>Israel intends to attack Iran. They intend to attack within the next six months. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/mitt-romney/9436624/Mitt-Romney-backs-Israeli-military-action-against-Iran.html">Mr. Romney has stated he will encourage that attack</a>, and would likely commit US forces to such an engagement. President Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric is less transparent, and does include support for Israel, but at least stops short of pushing for war with Iran and instead includes continued pushes for a diplomatic solution to the situation.</p>

<p>The three Es and Health Care are issues this nation will need to grapple with, and are serious issues. They are not the pressing issue that will come to a head in the next six months, defining the next decade of international conflict.</p>

<p>This election will be a referendum on US policy in Israel. Will that be a policy of war?</p>

<p><strong>Update Monday, September 2nd:</strong></p>

<p>It seems the Obama administration is <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-to-iran-in-case-of-israeli-strike-dont-fire-on-our-bases/">increasingly vocal in opposing</a> a unilateral Israeli strike. I&rsquo;m very interested in what Senator Kerry has in his speech at the DNC, and in what Obama will say at the UN on the 25th.</p>

    <updated>2011-08-31T23:27:41-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://DavidSouther.github.io/2011/08/interview_with_a_conspiracy_theorist</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What follows is a conversation I had with a conspiracy theorist on Facebook today.</p>

<p><strong>Jen Gross</strong>
seriously.
<a href="http://act.credoaction.com"> Tell Eric Cantor: Release the hostages and stop blocking funds for urgently needed disaster relief</a>
It&rsquo;s outrageous to take advantage of the urgent needs of hurricane survivors in order to cut Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security. But that&rsquo;s what Eric Cantor is doing by refusing to allocate money to disaster relief unless Congress first offsets that money with cuts to vital government programs.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Why do we only worry about these little issues ?</p>

<p><strong>Jen Gross</strong> because lots of people are flooded out of their homes and dealing w/ some pretty heavy damage. meanwhile eric cantor is putting up red tape, preventing the federal government from taking decisive action to help real people.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> My point is that this happens everyday in third world countries ! Poverty , war , disease and we do nothing ! We are taxed to death illegally and all that money goes to shit ! We could change this world so this stuff doesn&rsquo;t happen ! We must first change the system !</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>David Souther</strong> And how, exactly, do you propose to do that, @Josh Carey?</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Very simple !Stop supporting the failed system, stop giving them power ! A revolution if u will , they happen all the time throughout history to better the people :)</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> That doesn&rsquo;t sound simple at all. First, what are the broken systems? Second, how are they broken? How does the current popular movements in the Arab Spring effect your rabblerousing revolutionarianism?</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> ‎@ David ! I&rsquo;m at work , let me get home and I will elaborate!</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Sure, I look forward to reading what you have.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> ‎@ David, I&rsquo;ll give u 2 examples of this broken system as u call it . First lets start with the IRS. The IRS has been an illegal system since its unlawful inception in the early 1900&rsquo;s. It is nothing more than a criminal organization. If you do not know this story, you should. Second how about the Federal Reserve. In 1913 the Federal Reserve Act was fraudulently pushed through Congress. In the united States we have, in effect, two governments&hellip;.We have the duly constituted Government&hellip;.Then we have an independent, uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the Federal Reserve System, operating the money powers which are reserved to Congress by the Constitution. Unelected people run this planet, the government is a front for the Inertnational Bankers ! The world is not as it seems, it is how it is presented to us . As for the uprising in the arab world ! I&rsquo;m not sure, I don&rsquo;t care to comment .</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Last I checked, the IRS was started with the position of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue under Lincoln in 1862. That agency was renamed in the 1950s as the Internal Revenue Service. The commissioner and chief counsel are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The event I think you&rsquo;re referring to in the &ldquo;early 1900s&rdquo; would be the 16th amendment to the constitution in 1916 authorizing an income tax. Now, I&rsquo;m not a JD, but I do believe that there is no higher law in this nation than the constitution. Actually, I don&rsquo;t need to be a JD for that- the document spends most of Article 6 saying just that.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve was founded in 1913, and does not, in fact, have oversight by the executive branch. However, the Fed is directly responsibly to congress, and thus does have indirect oversight by the people. I will use my &ldquo;I am not a JD&rdquo; line again and say, while not studied in this area of constitutional law, it seems the first 3 enumerated powers of congress in Article 1 Section 8 speak precisely to this issue of finding some mechanism to regulate the monetary proceedings of this nation. Whether the fed is the best such mechanism would, I think, be a good debate, but calling its passage fraudulent, while then stating it is anti-constitutional, seems a bit of a stretch.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Not only is there no law that requires most Americans to file an individual tax return, but the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wasn&rsquo;t even created by an act of Congress! As for the federal Reserve, Woodrow Wilson put it best ! &ldquo;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world &mdash; no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men. &rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Credit is an interesting beast, but by no means illegal. I&rsquo;m going to need more than the words of a cranky old President to convince me the entire system is illegal.</p>

<p>As for the founding of the IRS:
The Revenue Act of 1862
Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998</p>

<p>Still not a lawyer, but <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00006012----000-.html">25 U.S.C. § 6012</a> Persons required to make returns of income looks like a few laws requiring most Americans to file tax returns.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> The IRS is not a U.S. Government Agency. It is an Agency of the IMF. The IMF is an Agency of the UN.</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> ‎&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>What the FUCK!? Ok, I was playing along, but now you&rsquo;re just going batshit crazy. Or trolling. Please, tell me you&rsquo;re trolling, and not serious?</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> I&rsquo;m serious ! google it !</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> No. I will let you post links to that particular ball of mental fuck-upedness.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> It&rsquo;s not some giant seceret , Ron Paul talks about it !</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> <a href="http://truth11.com/2011/02/02/thirty-little-known-facts-about-america/">http://truth11.com/2011/02/02/thirty-little-known-facts-about-america/</a></p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> I&hellip; buh&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know what to say to that crockery&hellip;
Ok, I&rsquo;ll choose a couple of the easier ones, and then let you move back in with&hellip; whatever it is you keep yourself crazy with. (If there were a God, he would reveal himself in this moment by having you tell me you&rsquo;re just joking with all this. On the other hand, at least I&rsquo;m getting good reading out of it. The laws, not you or your fellow&hellip; whatever the hells you are.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;5. The U.S. does not have any employees because there is no longer a United States. No more reorganizations. After 200 years of bankruptcy it is finally over. <a href="http://waterindustry.org/12803.htm">Executive Order 12803</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Section 1. Definitions. For purposes of this order: (a) Privatization means the disposition or transfer of an infrastructure asset, such as by sale or by long-term lease, from a State or local government to a private party.</p>

<p>‎"Sec. 3. Privatization initiative. To the extent permitted by law, the head of each executive department and agency shall undertake the following actions: (a) Review those procedures affecting the management and disposition of federally financed infrastructure"</p>

<p>Etc. Generally, this XO calls for privatizing <em>SOME</em> infrastructure (roads, bridges, trains, electrical lines, etc). Hardly, &ldquo;No longer a united states&rdquo;</p>

<p>‎"1. The IRS is NOT a U.S. Government Agency. It is an Agency of the IMF."</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find CV-93-405E-EJE U.S.D.C.I.</p>

<p>Public Law 94-564 provides a mechanism for Bretton Woods system, an international monetary treaty, but no indication of handing the IRS over to the IMF.</p>

<p>Public Law 102-391 is an appropriations law for foreign financing. There is a large section stating that the US shall have a representative at the IMF. It does not mean the IRS is an agent of the IMF.</p>

<p>Fuck it, I&rsquo;m done. Go&hellip; go be crazy. I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> International Bankers founded the UN! The same that privately own the Federal reserve! They own all the centeral banks of the countries of this world with the exception of a few !</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> This is why we get no where in this world :( just blow it off!</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Yes, and 9/11 was a missile planted by Cheney, the moon landing happened in a roswell sound stage, the middle ages never actually happened, and you forgot, those UN bankers are actually dinosaurs.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Well I thought we were having a mature conversation, obviously not.</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> No, we stopped having a mature conversation when you spouted the IRS is part of the IMF conspiracy.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> it&rsquo;s not a conspiracy lol</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Yes, and Rick Santorum is not a bigot.</p>

<p>‎"A conspiracy theory is a belief which explains an event as the result of a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators to achieve a malevolent end.&ldquo; How is what you&rsquo;ve been presenting not a conspiracy theory?</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> This world is run in secret by shadow governments! You might want to look into &ldquo;human farming&rdquo; . Maybe this may help u understand the world better !</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thelawthatneverwas.com/">http://www.thelawthatneverwas.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Fuck it, sure, here&rsquo;s another link.
<a href="http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/jsiegel/Personal/taxes/IRSrefuses.htm#show">http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/jsiegel/Personal/taxes/IRSrefuses.htm#show</a></p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Why are people beating the IRS law then ?</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Citation, please. Also, define &ldquo;beating&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Have u even looked into the cases? Do you think that &frac34; of the states would say income tax is ok ?</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Please, PLEASE, stop crossing your arguments. It&rsquo;s worse than the Ghostbusters' proton streams.</p>

<p>You link to Bill Benson&rsquo;s site. He links to no corroborating evidence, just &ldquo;Buy my book!&rdquo; A quick google search for &ldquo;Bill Benson&rdquo; has <a href="http://www.quatloos.com/bill_benson_debunked.htm">http://www.quatloos.com/bill_benson_debunked.htm</a> as the second hit. The 3rd link is in support, 4th and 5th in opp, and the 6, about a Canadian hockey player. I can&rsquo;t find links to the actual court case Benson bitches about.</p>

<p>Now, back to two questions ago. What do you mean by &ldquo;Beating&rdquo; the IRS? Neither Benson, nor those using his arguments, seem to be &ldquo;Beating&rdquo; the IRS. They are soundly defeated in court.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> ok! you&rsquo;re offically brainwashed. Popular public opinion does not mean it&rsquo;s a fact . later !\</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Try using the Benson argument in court. See how far you get.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Try keeping a open mind and see how much u learn better yet !</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Ok, let&rsquo;s back up a ways. At the beginning of this discussion, you state we are &ldquo;taxed to death&rdquo; and complain that we could be doing something to help third-world countries. You imply a revolution of some form is what we need. Let us, for the sake of me &ldquo;keeping an open mind&rdquo; assume, purely for the sake of argument, the IRS is illegal/the IMF/etc. How would you propose such a revolution occur?</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> first we have to sway public opinion I guess ! People dub it &ldquo;awakening &rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Ok. How will you do that? And what would you do then?</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> I think it eventually unfolds, I can&rsquo;t say what will happen! some people think we become more intune with the universe in a holistic sense! Much knownledge the government has hidden from us in order to keep us productive and them in control I believe !</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> So&hellip; you don&rsquo;t actually have anything pragmatically constructive to add to the conversation?</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> A shift is taking place, we&rsquo;re becoming aware ! don&rsquo;t get me started on UFO&rsquo;s</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> No, you&rsquo;re right. Please, don&rsquo;t start on UFOs. You&rsquo;ve shed enough crazy tears for the day.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> thats the problem why more people not speak out ! they ridicule others! I don&rsquo;t care anymore becasuse i know as do many other people that this life need to be seen with a open mind ! it&rsquo;s amazing what passes for adulthood in this world !</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> It&rsquo;s also amazing what passes as acceptable typing skills in this world.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> It&rsquo;s not acceptable to question life, this is not in accordance with popular public opinion ! I seek a better world at my very heart, if that&rsquo;s wrong then I don&rsquo;t wanna be right !</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> I believe you seek that better wold in your heart. At your heart would imply a proximity precariously close to the metaphorical world revolving around you. Also, what&rsquo;s with the spaces before the exclamation marks? It adds yet another difficulty to reading what you write.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> Maybe u could stay focused on the issues instead of grammar ?</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Dude, you&rsquo;re long past talking about issues. You have discredited yourself in so many ways, it&rsquo;s kinda&hellip; whatever. Yes, questioning the world is a good thing. That said, presenting answers that are factually wrong has moved long past questioning and into lala land.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> well I&rsquo;m sorry u feel that way ! so foreign it must be for you. I guess when I was your age I thought much the same way you do.</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> What way do I feel? I&rsquo;ve never been psychoanalyzed over the internet by a conspiracy theorist before!</p>

<p><strong>Josh Carey</strong> lol very cute ! good night !</p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> Night. Sweet dreams! I hope the aliens don&rsquo;t anal probe you!</p>

    <link href="http://DavidSouther.github.io/2011/02/american-empire"/>
    <updated>2011-02-14T20:56:11-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://DavidSouther.github.io/2011/02/american-empire</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: I originally wrote this in February 2011, at the beginning of the Arab Spring. It goes on a little bit of a ramble, and I really should have tried to focus, but it&rsquo;s just a personal essay.</em></p>

<p>Twenty-three years ago, the Soviet Empire collapsed. With the resignation of Hosni Mubarak and the continued protests and revolutions sweeping North Africa and the Middle East, the American empire is collapsing. As with the collapse of the Soviet Empire, the power vacuum created in the wake of social change in north Africa will rewrite the international political landscape. Alarmingly, the potential for disaster is much higher today than in 1988. America&rsquo;s empire has been the lightest-handed of empires as history goes. It levies no taxes in Egypt or South Korea or Iraq that return to the federal government, yet all international crude oil exchanges are based on the dollar&mdash; this requires all foreign nations to continue to buy into the American economy, even as it approaches a $14.5 trillion debt. The amount of foreign aid the US gives each year to states with ``sympathetic governments" in return for favorable trade policies and military support puts the United States in the same class as Rome and England. In return for the dollar being the baseline for international currency, the United States exports culture and brands to every corner of the globe, with more worldwide military presence than even England could muster in her prime. It is this size and might that makes America&rsquo;s potential fall so dangerous for the entire world economy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Revolutions</h3>

<p>History, especially since the 1700s, is littered with revolutions. Most failed. While nearly all were started by a disenfranchised citizenry, too many were ended not by an equitable restructuring of power but through a takeover by a hostile military presence which left the instigators even more powerless. Napoleon and the French Revolution, South Africa&rsquo;s Boer Wars followed by Apartheid, or Algeria and nearly 20 years of bloody civil war. America is an exception in overthrowing a government, and replacing it with something that was actually better for its people (neglecting the war over slavery 70 years later). Even so, look at the world today. France, after another 100 years of revolutions, did manage to emerge as a world leader in freedom and democracy. Germany, after the horrors of Nazism, has emerged as a country with one of the strongest economies world-wide. Germany&rsquo;s struggles after the second World War were not trivial - the separation amongst the super powers drew such disparity between East and West that it took the collapse of an empire to unite the country and make it possible to build that economy.</p>

<p>Revolutions involving empires affect everyone. In 1988, when the Berlin Wall fell, it was not a celebration just for the people of Berlin and Germany. The cold war was at an end, and one by one after Germany all of Eastern Europe threw off the yoke of Soviet rule. None faired as well as Germany. Armenia and Azerbaijan continued infighting and warring over ethnic regions, Belarus appointed an authoritarian democracy, and Yugoslavia stole the world stage with ethnic cleansing. Even as the threat of mutually assured destruction retreated, the world has yet to come to grips with the tensions unleashed after the fall of the USSR. The history of revolt is a troubling one, and there is little historical evidence of a people&rsquo;s revolt ending in happiness and prosperity. It is this history that must be kept firmly in mind when examining the causes and fallout of today&rsquo;s protests.</p>

<h3>Youth Leading Freedom</h3>

<p>One striking difference between the revolutions in America in the 1770s and Germany in the late 1980s is a similarity between Germany and today&rsquo;s movements in north Africa. The revolutions of the past 30 years share a youthful and energetic leadership, which have used mass media in drastically new ways. The American Revolution was largely pushed by the landowners and the wealthy, whereas the revolutions in the last 25 years have been driven by the youth empowered with forms of communication their governments could not control. In East Germany, the allure of western culture and the prosperity of the free market, as well as the artistic freedom of western culture, drove artists and intellectuals to spark the revolution against censorship, Chancellor Honeker, and ultimately the entire Soviet regime. In Egypt, the youth movement utilize Twitter, Facebook, and other social networking services to organize massive protests, and organize those protests in the face of a government working with all its might to stop those outlets of communication.</p>

<p>With these channels of communication, it must be very difficult to miss the glaring differences in standards of living between countries with authoritarian regimes, and countries with true democracies and equitable free markets. Many in Egypt have lived under the same president for their entire lives. This should be unheard of in a healthy democracy. While Hosni Mubarak has claimed victories of 80% of the vote in polls for the last three decades, the most popular American presidential election only won 60% of the general vote. As the people of Egypt, Tunesia, Yemen, Iran, and elsewhere look around the governments of their countries, it seems apparent that the supposed power is held by relatively few &ndash; yet the number of disenfranchised populus is much larger. The victories of the past have often been popular uprisings. The labor unions of the late 19th century should be a prime example for how the many wield much greater power than the armed when standing shoulder to shoulder with their brothers and sisters. Seeing the protests of the people in history, and the protests of their neighbors today should be enough to give many the impetus to seize control of their governments. It has been said that when it becomes necessary to dissolve political bonds which have held men together, respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare causes. For the people of these nations, the causes are self-evident.</p>

<p>While it is right and just that the people of Egypt, Tunesia, Algeria, and others should dissolve the current governments, the rest of the world must watch and consider what this will mean to the future for the rest of the peoples of Earth. It is possible (indeed, historically probable) that many of these governments will be replaced with a more authoritarian ruler. This is something the nations of the world must fight against. Overpopulation and unemployment are certainly concerns to a healthy and self-actualized populace, but if a junta or all-out dictatorship is allowed to flourish in the wake of these protests, genocide seems inevitable. The people of Egypt, should immediately request and demand that the ruling military council be replaced with a United Nations peacekeeping force until democratic elections are carried out and the government transitions to a new civilian leadership. This request must come from inside Egypt- otherwise, it will merely be another unilateral intervention by the United States.</p>

<p>Assuming the worst case scenario doesn&rsquo;t happen, it is very unlikely that any government that replaces Mubarak will be quite as open and friendly to American interests as Mubarak. This will not be a serious blow to US military power, or create a power vacuum filled by terrorist extremists. It has been pointed out many times already that the Egyptians have just as much interest as America, and every other modern state, to shun violent extremism and work to effectively combat it whenever possible. If the Muslim Brotherhood did win a majority leadership in Egypt, they would be foolish to take any serious actions contrary to the status quo. A serious military engagement with Israel would be catastrophic for Egypt. A change in posture pressuring Israel to change its policy regarding Palestine may actually help stabalize the region. Whatever happens, a gap will grow between Egypt and the United States.</p>

<p>As nations like Egypt become less tied to the United States, it becomes easier to look for alternative international currencies. If it were possible to buy a barrel of oil using the Euro, or the Yuan, there would no longer be a dependency on the US dollar for nations, especially African, Asian, and South American nations, to buy US dollars. With a stronger Muslim leadership in Egypt, treaties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, or Egypt and Iran, could significantly change the balance of power in international money concerns. If a new Egyptian government pushes the Iranian Oil Bourse to start selling crude, the world currencies would open to more than just the dollar.</p>

<h3>Internal Struggles</h3>

<p>The importance of a strong currency for an empire&rsquo;s continued success cannot be understated. The cold war has been described, not unjustly, as a race between the United States and the Soviet Union of which nation could spend more faster. Just as the Soviet Union was reaching a budget and social crisis while the Berlin wall fell, so too is America facing similar problems. America&rsquo;s deficit spending as percentage of GDP is not unprecedented, but there seem to be very few who are comfortable with the US National Debt at $14.5 trillion. The first few months of 2011 have seen a shaping political battle over a budget that seems unfathomable by mere mortals. The midterm elections in 2010 saw a trail of campaign rhetoric and a swing in the political power base unprecedented in electoral history. In the wake of the 2008 housing crisis, the American people are deeply concerned with the state of the nation and the world, yet seem unable to find an appropriate outlet or leadership to emerge strong.</p>

<p>On a world scale, this debate and discussion the budget has sparked at all levels of US politics is much more important than the actual dollar amount of the US Federal Debt. With the rise of the Tea Party and their call for smaller government, the conservative bloc in the US is creating a frenzied and fervent political environment. This is an environment where solutions cannot be presented because they might be too difficult, when in fact they are not. Polls consistently show there is no area of the Federal budget that Americans want to see cut. All the services provided by the Federal government are seen as necessary and vital. All the services provided by the Federal government demand jobs. Cutting these services will put Americans out of work. There is only one conclusion: the Federal Government must increase its sources of revenue. In the globalized economy, tariffs are out of the question. This leaves two main sources of revenue, taxes and fines.</p>

<p>Mainstream conspiracy theorists like Fox News' Glenn Beck are presenting an irrational and inconsistent view of the realities of today&rsquo;s world. This is a dangerous way to discuss policy on any level. Glenn Beck&rsquo;s rhetoric when backed by a network as powerful and respected as Fox News opens the door for irrational and patently false propaganda to spread and influence decisions. The American electorate is called to support candidates whose policies will harken a throwback to a turn of the 20th century state, with the worst of free market abuses destroying the lives and livelihood of the very people who were coerced into voting to allow it.</p>

<h3>The World Tomorrow</h3>

<p>If America follows that path, revolutions will only serve to further weaken the United States. Whether they are replaced with a successful and peaceful democracy or with a new but different authoritarian regime, governments will not be as friendly to today&rsquo;s United States. An America guided by fear and irrationality will certainly not support any new Egyptian government. China will seize any opportunity it has to improve relations with African nations. If the United States were to be so pinheaded as to return to a gold standard, China will need countries to export to. An emerging Africa and an emerging South America fit that bill perfectly. The path advocated by the Tea Party and Fox News is the path of American isolationism and a nation that is irrelevant on the world stage. With no other nations to step in as strong humanitarian leaders, many revolutionary nations will not follow in the footsteps of the United States or Germany, but rather fall into yet another authoritarian government. The concept of human rights will be null and void, and the world will live under a state-sponsored anarchy, where the strong get stronger and the weak are destroyed and trampled. Humanity will fall to a second dark age.</p>

<p>This is not the only path available. One alternative is a shift in American foreign policy. The age of super powers is past. Shock and awe military tactics will not deter terrorism. Russia and China are not credible military threats. Both nations know that while there is no threat of mutually assured destruction, there is a promise of mutually assured destruction, which neither nation will risk. This leaves Pakistan, India, Iran, and North Korea as the only major nuclear threats. None of these nations would be so stupid as to attack the United States, China, or Russia directly, but an attack on South Korea, Israel, or India and Pakistan attacking each other is not out of the question. A strong American military will do nothing to deter these attacks, and US involvement will only make China&rsquo;s reaction stronger. In this scenario, western intervention is untenable.</p>

<p>The solution is two-fold. The United States must make drastic cuts to the Department of Defense, while simultaneously strengthening the United Nations as a body with actual peace-keeping possibilities. This is not unprecedented. After Shay&rsquo;s rebellion in 1787, a fledgling union of states saw their Articles of Confederation were not enough to keep that nation together. The wealthy landowners who had thrown off oppressive rule ten years earlier reconvened to rewrite the rules of their new nation. Chief amongst those was a strong federal military and a mechanism for funding the federal government. The arguments between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists are the same arguments that will happen around a strengthened (or rewritten) United Nations, but the conclusion is the same. There must be a strong international federal government that serves all of humanity. With such a government, we will guarantee a productive and healthy future for all. Without such a government, we will guarantee a future where our children struggle for the most basic of living necessities.</p>
