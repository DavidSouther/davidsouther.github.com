The fire in your eyes sets my heart aflame

the spark that lights the tinder in my soul
which, bereft of the waters of love, dried
but did not blow away. Waiting,
instead, to flame up, 'till, engulfed with passion,
the detritus burned away leaving
fertile fields to sow the tears of your beauty.

Nurtured by the passions of our love,
tended by the tender touch we share,
blooming in a garden we share
in my breast, my mind.

Art in the halls art on the walls
Paintings and sculpture oh my 
A Garden inside to read if you will
Galleries filled for the eyes

An Ancient Pine forest with a mountain stream 
Serene to behold, even without green
That babbling Brook flows strong in winter 
The beauty of Swiss caught with watercolor 
(Alexandre calame 1847)

Hippolyte Petitjean dimples so tight 
Her watercolors still capture light 
Sedative scenes made of single points 
Each lovingly placed with a deft touch 
(promenade by a lake, a river landscape, etc)

Fishing boats tossed before a storm 
Isabey throws the paint ashore 
The fishermen cower 'fore nature's roar 
Yet ride it through in courageous form 
(1840)

Degas, Rodin! Their sculptures show 
Humanity in all our throws 
Romantic: grotesque 
Or plump, yet true?

Hunting in the Pontine Marches 
Mighty Oaks felled low as passing time
The moment captures rifle's aim
The Hound, faithful, pointing, leaves impression
(Horace Vernet, 1833)

People move through 
some with opinions, Others thoughts 
One in a few, even appreciation 
The creations of peers moving them so

Too much to see in a day or a life,
so we pick and we choose
what fancies delights;
then, at the end, the cherubs alight.

I walk her streets alone, awake;
I walk her streets with friends.
Alive we feel some million folks
enjoying her embrace.

Her lights are bright,
yet throw shadows
enough in length to hide
where sounds abound, yet lie.

Her grids ensnare
whom drives across.
"Go below" her whisper,
strong but soft.

Then a whoosh and a rattle
goes her train!
The clank crescendo
from her veins!

A honk, a squeal! The rubber grips
while I on foot move apace,
Hundreds, thousands, also walk
free from the bonds of oil to race.

The buildings are tall, her skin.
Steel and concrete, for those within
to sit above and look upon
her lustrous fair visage.

Green still is found near every where.
Her parks day and night for lovers wait.
The squirrels beg, the rats grow fat.
And pigeons? Crap on your hat.

Her shops will sell most anything.
"What Price" you ask without a tag.
Her people though surprise you so,
"It's my gift, you need it more."

Of course with millions all around
Some less savory can be found.
"What Price" you ask without a fare-
less pleasant a night you're not aware.

She is a bitch, when she wants to be.
Abusive, yes, but then, so welcoming.
Keep your wits, and love her too.
She will always be with you.
