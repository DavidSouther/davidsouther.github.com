  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have never seen a large CSS file that I thought was maintainable. In programming languages, we use indentation exhaustively to provide visual cues of related blocks of code. Unfortunately, CSS is often a giant wall of text, with all selectors at col 0 and all properties starting 1 tab deep. Instead, CSS blocks should be indented based on their selector’s expressiveness. In the example, we have body, a, and .content-wrapper all at the same level. Then, we indent .content-wrapper h1 one extra level, visually demarcating it as subordinate to .content-wrapper. In large CSS files, not only does this make it much easier to quickly scroll code, it discourages excessively deep selectors, encouraging designers to be more descriptive and accurate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do not wrap lines of code.

<ul>
<li>If a line starts getting longer than 79 characters, it should be refactored.

<ul>
<li>Narrow screens are still not uncommon. Many programmers have toolbars and other windows taking up the sides of the screen. The human field of vision still needs to scan vertically. 80 is still the magic number for line width.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wrap lines of comments at the 79th column</li>
<li>Always break comment lines on a space, don’t hyphenate by hand.</li>
</ul>


<h3>File Format</h3>

<ul>
<li>Files should be saved with Unicode (UTF-8) encoding.

<ul>
<li>It just works well, and most tools expect and handle UTF-8 well.</li>
<li>The BOM should not be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unix line endings should be used (LF, \n).

<ul>
<li>Most source control tools expect, and greatly prefer, Unix line endings.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory">QFT</a> says that all particles are indistinguishable from one-another [1]. That is, take a proton from cosmic ray from a supernova a billion light-yeas away, and compare it to a proton that just got smashed out in the LHC, and they are indistinguishable from one-another. Replace either with the other, and nothing will change. (As I understand) this applies to all particles that arise from the standard model fields- fermions and bosons. So if I have an atom, all the electrons in the atom are indistinguishable from all the other electrons in the atom. Theoretically I then take that atom and interchange it with any other &ldquo;indistinguishable&rdquo; atom. Or can I?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m writing a book! I have a degree in computer science, but that&rsquo;s really not what I do. I am a software developer, which focuses on a rather different aspect of computers and programming than what most computer science degrees offer. In my undergraduate work, there were maybe a half-dozen group assignments in the entire 4 year program. In the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, software is almost never developed in isolation. So, I want to write a textbook that introduces software craftsmanship to someone who has never programmed in their life. After working through this book, the reader will be able to go forth into the great realm of software development with an overview of the basic tools of both how to program, and how to collaborate with other programmers. I&rsquo;ll be posting PDFs of the book online as I work on drafts.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Note: I originally wrote this in February 2011, at the beginning of the Arab Spring. It goes on a little bit of a ramble, and I really should have tried to focus, but it&rsquo;s just a personal essay.</em></p>

<p>Twenty-three years ago, the Soviet Empire collapsed. With the resignation of Hosni Mubarak and the continued protests and revolutions sweeping North Africa and the Middle East, the American empire is collapsing. As with the collapse of the Soviet Empire, the power vacuum created in the wake of social change in north Africa will rewrite the international political landscape. Alarmingly, the potential for disaster is much higher today than in 1988. America&rsquo;s empire has been the lightest-handed of empires as history goes. It levies no taxes in Egypt or South Korea or Iraq that return to the federal government, yet all international crude oil exchanges are based on the dollar&mdash; this requires all foreign nations to continue to buy into the American economy, even as it approaches a $14.5 trillion debt. The amount of foreign aid the US gives each year to states with &#8220;sympathetic governments&#8221; in return for favorable trade policies and military support puts the United States in the same class as Rome and England. In return for the dollar being the baseline for international currency, the United States exports culture and brands to every corner of the globe, with more worldwide military presence than even England could muster in her prime. It is this size and might that makes America&rsquo;s potential fall so dangerous for the entire world economy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One day, the two Captains were standing on a Reimann Surface. As they begin to explore their interesting predicament, they encounter a pan-dimensional being with projections into their space. Being explorers and men of science, they approach this pan-dimensional being, and make contact. After a few rounds of introductions, the pan-dimensional being reveals to them it is on a quest, to find a being in the universe able to hear and understand the funniest joke in the world, without dying. Being the villain of this vignette, he of course threatens them with death if they don&rsquo;t comply.</p>

<p>So, the two captains agree to hear the joke, and immediately, their ears are filled with the sound of German. &ldquo;Wenn ist das Nunstück git und Slotermeyer? Ja! … Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Interestingly, neither the Iowan nor the Frenchman die upon hearing it. In fact, they both have a mildly puzzled expression. Then, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Picard begins to chuckle. Neither the pan-dimensional being nor Kirk understand quite how Picard sees this humorous, so Picard explains the irony to them. The pan-dimensional being has never been so astounded in its existence, and immediately returns the two captains to normal, every-day Euclidean spacetime on the bridge of the Enterprise. Kirk is still a bit confused (not the least because this is the Enterprise E), and asks Picard again for an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple, really- the proof Lies in group theory.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Roadmap to Home Sapiens Coniunctus</h3>

<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: I used to be a terrible writer. This is a paper I wrote for a course in Artificial Intelligence at Rocky.</em></p>

<p><strong>David Souther</strong> <em>4/9/2008</em></p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s world, computers are tools to help humanity process information. Engineers design hardware and programs with the express purpose of helping humans communicate and think more efficiently, but not necessarily more creatively. Computers make it easier to deal with large amounts of information, but we still need people to decide rules on which analysis is possible. The field of artificial intelligence aims to destroy that by removing humans from the equation, so the machines alone can think, decide, and improve. In all science fiction, and most science fact, AI computers are either controlling overlords or degraded slaves. It seems, however, that modern pursuits and trends point towards a more harmonious, if not utopian, symbiosis between man and machine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Dichotomy in modern tragedy</h3>

<p>Mary Shelley&rsquo;s <em>Frankenstein</em> and William Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Hamlet</em> are two revenge stories which present a twist on classic Aristotelian tragedy. The dichotomy in the titular characters&#8217; tragic flights, one based on faith, the other on logic, especially emphasize that choices, not fate, which rule the modern tragic protagonist.</p>

<p>Frankenstein&rsquo;s fall, and need for revenge, is seated firmly in his scientific reasoning. Natural science (where Alchemy may be called that) led Victor to animate his first creature. When confronted with the decision of animating a second creature, Victor&#8217; logic leads him to choose the proven needs of the many over the possible wants of the few.</p>

<p>Hamlet, on the other hand, focuses his logic entirely on faith and intuition. Without faith in the ghost, there would be no cause for undue suspicion against Claudius; without that suspicion, there would be no catalyst for the mousetrap play, the ranting madness, or the long spoken personal essays looking into himself. The distance between the two calls for revenge is immense, though both are grounded in the logic of what each character believes (after much consideration) to be the truth.</p>
