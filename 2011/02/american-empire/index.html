<div class="entry-content"><p><em>Note: I originally wrote this in February 2011, at the beginning of the Arab Spring. It goes on a little bit of a ramble, and I really should have tried to focus, but it&rsquo;s just a personal essay.</em></p>

<p>Twenty-three years ago, the Soviet Empire collapsed. With the resignation of Hosni Mubarak and the continued protests and revolutions sweeping North Africa and the Middle East, the American empire is collapsing. As with the collapse of the Soviet Empire, the power vacuum created in the wake of social change in north Africa will rewrite the international political landscape. Alarmingly, the potential for disaster is much higher today than in 1988. America&rsquo;s empire has been the lightest-handed of empires as history goes. It levies no taxes in Egypt or South Korea or Iraq that return to the federal government, yet all international crude oil exchanges are based on the dollar&mdash; this requires all foreign nations to continue to buy into the American economy, even as it approaches a $14.5 trillion debt. The amount of foreign aid the US gives each year to states with &#8220;sympathetic governments&#8221; in return for favorable trade policies and military support puts the United States in the same class as Rome and England. In return for the dollar being the baseline for international currency, the United States exports culture and brands to every corner of the globe, with more worldwide military presence than even England could muster in her prime. It is this size and might that makes America&rsquo;s potential fall so dangerous for the entire world economy.</p>

<h3>Revolutions</h3>

<p>History, especially since the 1700s, is littered with revolutions. Most failed. While nearly all were started by a disenfranchised citizenry, too many were ended not by an equitable restructuring of power but through a takeover by a hostile military presence which left the instigators even more powerless. Napoleon and the French Revolution, South Africa&rsquo;s Boer Wars followed by Apartheid, or Algeria and nearly 20 years of bloody civil war. America is an exception in overthrowing a government, and replacing it with something that was actually better for its people (neglecting the war over slavery 70 years later). Even so, look at the world today. France, after another 100 years of revolutions, did manage to emerge as a world leader in freedom and democracy. Germany, after the horrors of Nazism, has emerged as a country with one of the strongest economies world-wide. Germany&rsquo;s struggles after the second World War were not trivial -Â the separation amongst the super powers drew such disparity between East and West that it took the collapse of an empire to unite the country and make it possible to build that economy.</p>

<p>Revolutions involving empires affect everyone. In 1988, when the Berlin Wall fell, it was not a celebration just for the people of Berlin and Germany. The cold war was at an end, and one by one after Germany all of Eastern Europe threw off the yoke of Soviet rule. None faired as well as Germany. Armenia and Azerbaijan continued infighting and warring over ethnic regions, Belarus appointed an authoritarian democracy, and Yugoslavia stole the world stage with ethnic cleansing. Even as the threat of mutually assured destruction retreated, the world has yet to come to grips with the tensions unleashed after the fall of the USSR. The history of revolt is a troubling one, and there is little historical evidence of a people&rsquo;s revolt ending in happiness and prosperity. It is this history that must be kept firmly in mind when examining the causes and fallout of today&rsquo;s protests.</p>

<h3>Youth Leading Freedom</h3>

<p>One striking difference between the revolutions in America in the 1770s and Germany in the late 1980s is a similarity between Germany and today&rsquo;s movements in north Africa. The revolutions of the past 30 years share a youthful and energetic leadership, which have used mass media in drastically new ways. The American Revolution was largely pushed by the landowners and the wealthy, whereas the revolutions in the last 25 years have been driven by the youth empowered with forms of communication their governments could not control. In East Germany, the allure of western culture and the prosperity of the free market, as well as the artistic freedom of western culture, drove artists and intellectuals to spark the revolution against censorship, Chancellor Honeker, and ultimately the entire Soviet regime. In Egypt, the youth movement utilize Twitter, Facebook, and other social networking services to organize massive protests, and organize those protests in the face of a government working with all its might to stop those outlets of communication.</p>

<p>With these channels of communication, it must be very difficult to miss the glaring differences in standards of living between countries with authoritarian regimes, and countries with true democracies and equitable free markets. Many in Egypt have lived under the same president for their entire lives. This should be unheard of in a healthy democracy. While Hosni Mubarak has claimed victories of 80% of the vote in polls for the last three decades, the most popular American presidential election only won 60% of the general vote. As the people of Egypt, Tunesia, Yemen, Iran, and elsewhere look around the governments of their countries, it seems apparent that the supposed power is held by relatively few &ndash; yet the number of disenfranchised populus is much larger. The victories of the past have often been popular uprisings. The labor unions of the late 19th century should be a prime example for how the many wield much greater power than the armed when standing shoulder to shoulder with their brothers and sisters. Seeing the protests of the people in history, and the protests of their neighbors today should be enough to give many the impetus to seize control of their governments. It has been said that when it becomes necessary to dissolve political bonds which have held men together, respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare causes. For the people of these nations, the causes are self-evident.</p>

<p>While it is right and just that the people of Egypt, Tunesia, Algeria, and others should dissolve the current governments, the rest of the world must watch and consider what this will mean to the future for the rest of the peoples of Earth. It is possible (indeed, historically probable) that many of these governments will be replaced with a more authoritarian ruler. This is something the nations of the world must fight against. Overpopulation and unemployment are certainly concerns to a healthy and self-actualized populace, but if a junta or all-out dictatorship is allowed to flourish in the wake of these protests, genocide seems inevitable. The people of Egypt, should immediately request and demand that the ruling military council be replaced with a United Nations peacekeeping force until democratic elections are carried out and the government transitions to a new civilian leadership. This request must come from inside Egypt- otherwise, it will merely be another unilateral intervention by the United States.</p>

<p>Assuming the worst case scenario doesn&rsquo;t happen, it is very unlikely that any government that replaces Mubarak will be quite as open and friendly to American interests as Mubarak. This will not be a serious blow to US military power, or create a power vacuum filled by terrorist extremists. It has been pointed out many times already that the Egyptians have just as much interest as America, and every other modern state, to shun violent extremism and work to effectively combat it whenever possible. If the Muslim Brotherhood did win a majority leadership in Egypt, they would be foolish to take any serious actions contrary to the status quo. A serious military engagement with Israel would be catastrophic for Egypt. A change in posture pressuring Israel to change its policy regarding Palestine may actually help stabalize the region. Whatever happens, a gap will grow between Egypt and the United States.</p>

<p>As nations like Egypt become less tied to the United States, it becomes easier to look for alternative international currencies. If it were possible to buy a barrel of oil using the Euro, or the Yuan, there would no longer be a dependency on the US dollar for nations, especially African, Asian, and South American nations, to buy US dollars. With a stronger Muslim leadership in Egypt, treaties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, or Egypt and Iran, could significantly change the balance of power in international money concerns. If a new Egyptian government pushes the Iranian Oil Bourse to start selling crude, the world currencies would open to more than just the dollar.</p>

<h3>Internal Struggles</h3>

<p>The importance of a strong currency for an empire&rsquo;s continued success cannot be understated. The cold war has been described, not unjustly, as a race between the United States and the Soviet Union of which nation could spend more faster. Just as the Soviet Union was reaching a budget and social crisis while the Berlin wall fell, so too is America facing similar problems. America&rsquo;s deficit spending as percentage of GDP is not unprecedented, but there seem to be very few who are comfortable with the US National Debt at $14.5 trillion. The first few months of 2011 have seen a shaping political battle over a budget that seems unfathomable by mere mortals. The midterm elections in 2010 saw a trail of campaign rhetoric and a swing in the political power base unprecedented in electoral history. In the wake of the 2008 housing crisis, the American people are deeply concerned with the state of the nation and the world, yet seem unable to find an appropriate outlet or leadership to emerge strong.</p>

<p>On a world scale, this debate and discussion the budget has sparked at all levels of US politics is much more important than the actual dollar amount of the US Federal Debt. With the rise of the Tea Party and their call for smaller government, the conservative bloc in the US is creating a frenzied and fervent political environment. This is an environment where solutions cannot be presented because they might be too difficult, when in fact they are not. Polls consistently show there is no area of the Federal budget that Americans want to see cut. All the services provided by the Federal government are seen as necessary and vital. All the services provided by the Federal government demand jobs. Cutting these services will put Americans out of work. There is only one conclusion: the Federal Government must increase its sources of revenue. In the globalized economy, tariffs are out of the question. This leaves two main sources of revenue, taxes and fines.</p>

<p>Mainstream conspiracy theorists like Fox News&#8217; Glenn Beck are presenting an irrational and inconsistent view of the realities of today&rsquo;s world. This is a dangerous way to discuss policy on any level. Glenn Beck&rsquo;s rhetoric when backed by a network as powerful and respected as Fox News opens the door for irrational and patently false propaganda to spread and influence decisions. The American electorate is called to support candidates whose policies will harken a throwback to a turn of the 20th century state, with the worst of free market abuses destroying the lives and livelihood of the very people who were coerced into voting to allow it.</p>

<h3>The World Tomorrow</h3>

<p>If America follows that path, revolutions will only serve to further weaken the United States. Whether they are replaced with a successful and peaceful democracy or with a new but different authoritarian regime, governments will not be as friendly to today&rsquo;s United States. An America guided by fear and irrationality will certainly not support any new Egyptian government. China will seize any opportunity it has to improve relations with African nations. If the United States were to be so pinheaded as to return to a gold standard, China will need countries to export to. An emerging Africa and an emerging South America fit that bill perfectly. The path advocated by the Tea Party and Fox News is the path of American isolationism and a nation that is irrelevant on the world stage. With no other nations to step in as strong humanitarian leaders, many revolutionary nations will not follow in the footsteps of the United States or Germany, but rather fall into yet another authoritarian government. The concept of human rights will be null and void, and the world will live under a state-sponsored anarchy, where the strong get stronger and the weak are destroyed and trampled. Humanity will fall to a second dark age.</p>

<p>This is not the only path available. One alternative is a shift in American foreign policy. The age of super powers is past. Shock and awe military tactics will not deter terrorism. Russia and China are not credible military threats. Both nations know that while there is no threat of mutually assured destruction, there is a promise of mutually assured destruction, which neither nation will risk. This leaves Pakistan, India, Iran, and North Korea as the only major nuclear threats. None of these nations would be so stupid as to attack the United States, China, or Russia directly, but an attack on South Korea, Israel, or India and Pakistan attacking each other is not out of the question. A strong American military will do nothing to deter these attacks, and US involvement will only make China&rsquo;s reaction stronger. In this scenario, western intervention is untenable.</p>

<p>The solution is two-fold. The United States must make drastic cuts to the Department of Defense, while simultaneously strengthening the United Nations as a body with actual peace-keeping possibilities. This is not unprecedented. After Shay&rsquo;s rebellion in 1787, a fledgling union of states saw their Articles of Confederation were not enough to keep that nation together. The wealthy landowners who had thrown off oppressive rule ten years earlier reconvened to rewrite the rules of their new nation. Chief amongst those was a strong federal military and a mechanism for funding the federal government. The arguments between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists are the same arguments that will happen around a strengthened (or rewritten) United Nations, but the conclusion is the same. There must be a strong international federal government that serves all of humanity. With such a government, we will guarantee a productive and healthy future for all. Without such a government, we will guarantee a future where our children struggle for the most basic of living necessities.</p>
