The quickest Italian dish ever. If you can't cook this, you shouldn't cook. (Actually, you should try it a few more times and figure out how to cook.) If you can't make this tasty, try a couple more times.

  * Spaghetti noodles
  * 1 lbs ground beef
  * 1 can Classico spaghetti sauce
  * Salt
  * Olive Oil

You're probably cooking your pasta wrong. Don't add pasta to boiling water. There's a weird reaction the outer pasta has that makes it sticky when you do that (and no, oil doesn't help much). Instead, put your dry pasta in a pan, cover with cold water (maybe a 1/4 inch above the pasta), and then turn on the heat. This lets the pasta get all wet and cooked before it starts to get soggy and clump. Add a dash of oil to keep the water from foaming and boiling over. You know now how to cook awesome pasta, of any kind. The only difference is thicker pastas will take longer.





For the sauce, brown the beef. Put a bit of oil in the pan, let it get nice and hot, add the beef, stir until well cooked. Again, don't fuck around with ground beef. Add the sauce, and let it simmer until hot. Depending on the noodles, it should be just the right temperature when the noodles finish.





### Alternatives







  1. Different pastas. There are so many friggin pastas. Use the same cold water on top approach, and they'll come out well every time. Except rice noodles, I still can't figure out how to cook those fuckers.

  2. Make your own sauce! (Guest post, coming soon!) There are probably as many sauce options than there are noodle options, so this is another great place to play around. Even with just the store-bought sauces, try adding different things to your beef when you fry it. I personally like diced onions, bell peppers, and olives.
