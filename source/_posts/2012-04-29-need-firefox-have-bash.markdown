For web development, we often need to test our code on multiple browsers. Firefox makes it really easy to run multiple versions side-by-side, so long as we take some care to not clobber profiles. This is a quick script to download and install the production versions of Firefox from 4 through 12 (13 is in beta1 as of this writing; 3.6 has no x86_64 support)
