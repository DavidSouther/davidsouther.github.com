In Special Relativity, the spacetime interval between two events is [latex]s^2 = -(c{\Delta}t)^2+({\Delta}x)^2+({\Delta}y)^2+({\Delta}z)^2[/latex] giving the Minkowski metric [latex]\eta_{\mu\nu}=\text{diag}(-1, 1, 1, 1)[/latex]. What is the justification for making time have a negative coefficient, and how closely is that related to the 2nd law of thermodynamics? Sure, by letting [latex]\eta = \text{diag}(1, 1, 1, 1)[/latex], we get a pretty boring spacetime, and the boosts in the Poincar√© group become trig instead of hyperbolic functions, but what's the physical reasoning behind this?
