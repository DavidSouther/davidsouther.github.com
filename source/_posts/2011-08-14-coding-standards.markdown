Coding standards are a Good Thing™. When working in a team it is critically important to be able to read code written by other developers, immediately understand what is happening and how they are thinking. Coding standards facilitate this process in two critical ways. One, standards remove the uncertainty of reading a new piece of code. A unified, followed standard guarantees that similar blocks will be formatted the same. Two, standards allow an additional layer of semantics for the human readers of code on top of the language features recognized by the compiler. This technique is part of programming into a language. The criterion for a good standard is fourfold. First, it should visually highlight the “flow” of the code. Second, it should make common typographical errors become fatal code smells. Third, it should be flexible to adapt to new languages and technologies. Fourth, it should encourage programmers to write literate code. Above all, these requirements follow the guiding principle of making software better to use and easier to write. These are my standards for code, with explanations for how they fit in these goals.
