One day, the two Captains were standing on a Reimann Surface. As they begin to explore their interesting predicament, they encounter a pan-dimensional being with projections into their space. Being explorers and men of science, they approach this pan-dimensional being, and make contact. After a few rounds of introductions, the pan-dimensional being reveals to them it is on a quest, to find a being in the universe able to hear and understand the funniest joke in the world, without dying. Being the villain of this vignette, he of course threatens them with death if they don't comply.

So, the two captains agree to hear the joke, and immediately, their ears are filled with the sound of German. "Wenn ist das Nunstück git und Slotermeyer? Ja! … Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput."

Interestingly, neither the Iowan nor the Frenchman die upon hearing it. In fact, they both have a mildly puzzled expression. Then, after a moment's reflection, Picard begins to chuckle. Neither the pan-dimensional being nor Kirk understand quite how Picard sees this humorous, so Picard explains the irony to them. The pan-dimensional being has never been so astounded in its existence, and immediately returns the two captains to normal, every-day Euclidean spacetime on the bridge of the Enterprise. Kirk is still a bit confused (not the least because this is the Enterprise E), and asks Picard again for an explanation.

"It's simple, really- the proof Lies in group theory."
