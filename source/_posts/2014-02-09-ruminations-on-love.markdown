Love is everything Hemingway says it is. Right now, the knot in the pit of the
stomach. The uplifting joy in the heart, under the left breast. Whenever
thoughts wander, they float to her. What does she think? How does she feel? I
need it. I detest it. It's all hormones, isn't it? An emergent collection of
chemicals? The adrenaline rushing the heart, some fight or flight response to
potential danger of rejection or loss? The serotonin eliciting "happiness",
things go right, feel right, the chemical payoff for achieving goals? No- this
is all lust.
