A group I'm active on in Facebook posted a link to a comment on the [possibilities of LED contact lenses](http://www.elementalled.com/leducation/blog/innovative-technology/led-lights-make-augmented-vision-a-reality/). Unfortunately, the post's author barely scratches the surface of what's possible with the potential applications. Also, the author calls this "Freaky." Not cool. For a unified approach to augmented reality, I want all the research resources of my desktop integrated into a complete hands-free environment. While this could just be fancy glasses and a bluetooth headset, I'm going to take freaky to the extreme, and only consider approaches that require surgery. Also, I'm going to try to stay in the realm of things I can sketch on how to make a technical possibility, and try to highlight everything I know is still science fiction. So, how can I make myself better with technology?

### Hearing

This one's actually pretty close to reality. Take current [invisible in ear canal hearing aids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid#Invisible_In_canal_hearing_aids_.28IIC.29), make them a bit smaller, and surgically implant them in a way replacing some cartilage of the exterior acoustic meatus and some of the mastoid process (requiring reattaching some muscles to this new device. No one ever said Science was easy.). Power could be provided by extending a flap of skin around a battery access point near the base of the aricula, or even as a gauge earing in the lobule. Necessary components would be the speaker, a the power, and a local minicomputer handling incoming audio. Also possible would be a small microphone in the area, for recording what you hear.


### Speech


Replace the third molar with a microphone. This will be a bit tricky, since speech isn't fully formed until it hits the lips, but I conjecture with appropriate software the intended audio signal could be reconstituted correctly. Power could come from wires run to to the aricula battery.


### Vision


The hardest, but coolest. Here, I want to replace the entire lens system with a camera/projector combo. This way, we don't need to reverse engineer the operation of the retina and optic nerve. Instead, we take advantage of our (relatively better) understanding of light and light hitting the retina. Power and transmitting data I could see being... difficult. Possibly taking advantage of EM inductance by placing a dielectric between the eye and the eyelid? The camera would capture image, then get composited with whatever we need to display from the control system.


### Command and Control


The coolest part I see of the camera/projector combo is the potential to virtually overlay a keyboard on any surface. Similar to [Celluon's Magic Cube](http://www.celluon.com/products/laserkey1_3.htm?sm=2_1), I could use my arm as the "surface" for a right-handed Dvorak keyboard, or sit down at an empty table and type by tapping on the table, the motion picked up and translated by the camera, then overlayed onto the projected image. Combined with a [verbal shell](http://davidsouther.com/2011/08/verbal-shell/), I see a lot of possibilities software-wise that could run on this platform. Say, adding a USB port in your arm, that the system accesses, and displays on your eye overlay using the same window manager as your OS.

Transmitting data has two possibilities. First, equipping every piece with a short-range wireless device (you'd need about 10cm for the ear, mouth, and eye). Or, running wires everywhere (following the nervous system, probably). Power could come from batteries at strategic locations, but there's also the turbines from a Swiss team that [fit inside arteries](http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/swiss-scientists-design-a-turbine-to-fit-in-human-arteries). With the levels of miniaturization I've described, I would target the system to 100 milliwatts. That would be enough to power 100 hearing aids.


### Is it possible?


Sure, these bionic mods are more sci-fi than sci-fact at this point in time. Still, I think these are reasonable goals I've laid out for a system. Honestly, I think with 5 years and a couple billion in dedicated funding, serious progress could be made on this project. The question, then, is how many people would want something like this... I would, but a lot might call it "freaky."


#### Disclaimer


I am WAY out of my field of computer science on this one, and sadly do not work with these parts of the body in this way on a daily basis. If I've said anything incredibly wrong (or even subtly stupid) please let me know in the comments. I really do think this project is possible, and want to keep thinking about it for some time (like, until it's a reality).


### PS.


I didn't even start on things like potential muscle enhancements. I'm a much more cerebral guy, but all the mods from [Deus Ex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex)... I think are closer than those game makers though.
