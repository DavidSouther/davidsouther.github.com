jQuery is the javascript library I've come to know and love. It just makes web development easy. I had an opportunity to give a presentation outlining the best features of jQuery to the company I work for, and it went over quite well. The audience was a technical audience of java-turned-web developers who have predominantly seen Dojo and Ext, but are still on the whole more comfortable with the pure Java technologies. The full presentation is [available online](http://davidsouther.github.com/jQuery-Best-Parts-presentation/), and the [code is on github](https://github.com/DavidSouther/jQuery-Best-Parts-presentation). There will be a pop-up the first time you visit the page to show the speaker notes. This is the transcript I presented from, and has the full descriptions of the code examples. You will want to use chrome to view the presentation, but fallback mode works for other browsers.
