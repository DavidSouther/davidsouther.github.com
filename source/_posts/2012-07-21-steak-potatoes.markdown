Nothing says good eating like a steaming plate of steaks, mashed potatoes, and country veggies. The best part? It's one of the easiest things you can cook. Follow along, and in half an hour you'll be having better steaks than they server at Morton's.


  * 2 to 4 Fillets, 1-2" thick.
  * 1 can whole kernel corn
  * 1 can sliced carrots
  * 1 can french-cut green beans
  * 1 white onion
  * 4-6 red potatoes
  * 2 tblsp butter
  * 1/4 quart half-and-half
  * Salt
  * Lawry's
  * Olive oil

Quarter the potatoes. We're doing mashed potatoes, so go fast and dirty here. Find the longest, thinnest part of the potato, cut in half, find the next thinnest side, cut in half, then cut the last side two or three times. At this point you'll have <1" cubes of potato. Put those potatoes & some salt in pot. Add water to ~1" above the potatoes. Add a dash (~1 teaspoon) of oil (this stops the water from boiling over. Place the pot over high heat.





Chop the onion. Start by cutting off the ends. I like larger chunks of onion, so I usually slice once through the thickest part of the onion, once through each half, then slice one of the quarters the long way and the other quarter radially. That gives a good combination of fat slices and long slices. Pour a couple dashes of oil into pan (not too much, just enough to start searing the onion). Bring oil to temperature. Over high heat this should take less than a minute; you'll know its ready when the oil starts to have rivulets when it flows over itself. Add the onions, stirring regularly until the onions are lightly cooked. Add some Lawry's. Clear out an area of the pan moving the onions to the side. Add steaks in the clearing, let them cook for about a minute, dash the uncooked side  with Lawry's, turn them over. Drain veggies from the can. Add veggies to the pan, add Lawry's to taste, stir, and cover. Wait about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.





When potatoes are done (easily pierced by fork), drain in colander and put back in pot. Rinse colander and place on drying rack. Add butter, half-and- half, and salt to potatoes. Mash. This makes the consistency I like; for thicker use more potatoes or less half-and-half; for thinner use less potatoes or thinner milk (whole, skim).





Steaks will take about 5 minutes / level: 5 minutes rare, 10 minutes medium rare, 15 minutes medium well, 20 minutes well done. Test by cutting open; after a few times, you'll get a feel for your stove and know when they're done without needing to check.





Wipe off counter, serve, & enjoy!





### Alternatives:

  1. Add clove, then onion.
  2. Use fresh veggies (adds ~5 minutes to dice).
  3. Use different meat: different steak cuts, pork, chicken, etc.
