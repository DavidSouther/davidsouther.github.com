I've wanted a different theme than most of what jQuery UI provides for some time. I don't like the overly rounded corners, the glass effects, and egregious whitespace. I have really liked the recent Light themes Google has been working on, as well as the Wordpress Admin theme. I had some time over the weekend, and migrated most of the big pieces of the Google Light theme to jQuery UI. The code is available at [http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-glight/](http://davidsouther.com/2011/11/jquery-ui-glight/) with a standalone demo [http://davidsouther.com/projects/glight/jquery-ui.html](http://davidsouther.com/projects/glight/jquery-ui.html) (though this isn't on a continuous integration setup, so it might lag a bit behind the code). The demo is iframed below.
