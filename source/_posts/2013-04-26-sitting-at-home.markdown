The fire in your eyes sets my heart aflame

the spark that lights the tinder in my soul
which, bereft of the waters of love, dried
but did not blow away. Waiting,
instead, to flame up, 'till, engulfed with passion,
the detritus burned away leaving
fertile fields to sow the tears of your beauty.

Nurtured by the passions of our love,
tended by the tender touch we share,
blooming in a garden we share
in my breast, my mind.
