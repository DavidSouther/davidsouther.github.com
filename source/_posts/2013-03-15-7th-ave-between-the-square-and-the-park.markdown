<pre>
I walk her streets alone, awake;
I walk her streets with friends.
Alive we feel some million folks
enjoying her embrace.

Her lights are bright,
yet throw shadows
enough in length to hide
where sounds abound, yet lie.

Her grids ensnare
whom drives across.
"Go below" her whisper,
strong but soft.

Then a whoosh and a rattle
goes her train!
The clank crescendo
from her veins!

A honk, a squeal! The rubber grips
while I on foot move apace,
Hundreds, thousands, also walk
free from the bonds of oil to race.

The buildings are tall, her skin.
Steel and concrete, for those within
to sit above and look upon
her lustrous fair visage.

Green still is found near every where.
Her parks day and night for lovers wait.
The squirrels beg, the rats grow fat.
And pigeons? Crap on your hat.

Her shops will sell most anything.
"What Price" you ask without a tag.
Her people though surprise you so,
"It's my gift, you need it more."

Of course with millions all around
Some less savory can be found.
"What Price" you ask without a fare-
less pleasant a night you're not aware.

She is a bitch, when she wants to be.
Abusive, yes, but then, so welcoming.
Keep your wits, and love her too.
She will always be with you.
