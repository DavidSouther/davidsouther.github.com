Like any skill, software craftsmanship takes practice. Because there are so many programming languages available, and each has something unique to offer, I've broken the programming exercises in the book out into separate workbooks. Each workbook follows the main text, providing programming tutorials that cover the main concepts in a specific language. I am writing these workbooks in three languages, C, Javascript, and Python.

*   Software Craftsmanship Python Workbook (Coming soon!)
