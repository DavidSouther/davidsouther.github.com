Fresh fish feels fantastically filling. This salmon bake is great year round, but an especially nice light summer dish.

  * Salmon Fillets
  * 1 Bell Pepper
  * half-dozen spears asparagus
  * 4 medium red potatoes
  * Olive Oil
  * Lemon juice

Pre-heat oven to 350.





Cover your baking sheet with aluminum foil (makes cleanup much easier, just throw the foil away). Drizzle light oil over the baking sheet.





Scallop potatoes, slicing them between an eighth and a quarter inch, and place the slices on an oiled baking sheet. Add a light dash salt and splash of lemon juice.





Slice pepper. To slice a bell pepper, cut from the top, near the stem, radially down. Rip out the seeds, throw out the stem, and keep slicing along the length of the bell until you have the thickness you want. Alternate pepper slices and asparagus spears in a layer on top of the potatoes. Add a light dash of salt and splash of lemon juice.





Place salmon fillet skin-down on the veggies, and add a splash of lemon juice.





Bake 15 minutes, or until salmon is nice and white.
