Crosslight is a way to use web development practices to bring dynamic content to the desktop. Using lighttpd as a base, and putting PHP and SQLite on top, we have a full application development and delivery platform that lets web designers and developers deliver fully-functioning, cross-platform desktop applications without having to learn new technologies.
