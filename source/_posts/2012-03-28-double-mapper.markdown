I've always loved places, and in loving places, have always loved maps. I've always been curious as to the relative size of places, as well. I'm decent at estimating some things, but lengths, not so much. To get a better understanding of the comparative sizes of places around the world, I put together these pair of Google Maps, superimposed over one-another to see exactly how these sizes work. Note that because of using two maps in a Mercator projection, the sizes technically only line up when the map centers are on the same latitude.
