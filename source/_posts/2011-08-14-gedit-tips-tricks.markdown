[gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) is awesome. Lightweight, with an excellent plugin ecosystem. It is a text editor. Not an IDE. Not a programming environment. All it does it text. That is a Good Thingâ„¢. With a few small tweaks, gedit will do LaTeX, C, C#, Haskell, or any other text-based thing you want to do. It embodies the Unix principle of doing one thing only and one thing well, while providing all the modern conventions we expect text editors to follow today (sorry, but both Vi and Emacs are weird for anyone who's learned to type in the last 10 years). gedit provides plenty of configuration options. These are the tips and tricks to make gedit just that much more awesome to help developers (me) meet the style guidelines I have here.

All of these settings are accessible form the Preferences menu (Edit -> Preferences)
