Art in the halls art on the walls
Paintings and sculpture oh my 
A Garden inside to read if you will
Galleries filled for the eyes


<!-- more -->


An Ancient Pine forest with a mountain stream 
Serene to behold, even without green
That babbling Brook flows strong in winter 
The beauty of Swiss caught with watercolor 
(Alexandre calame 1847)





Hippolyte Petitjean dimples so tight 
Her watercolors still capture light 
Sedative scenes made of single points 
Each lovingly placed with a deft touch 
(promenade by a lake, a river landscape, etc)





Fishing boats tossed before a storm 
Isabey throws the paint ashore 
The fishermen cower 'fore nature's roar 
Yet ride it through in courageous form 
(1840)





Degas, Rodin! Their sculptures show 
Humanity in all our throws 
Romantic: grotesque 
Or plump, yet true?





Hunting in the Pontine Marches 
Mighty Oaks felled low as passing time
The moment captures rifle's aim
The Hound, faithful, pointing, leaves impression
(Horace Vernet, 1833)





People move through 
some with opinions, Others thoughts 
One in a few, even appreciation 
The creations of peers moving them so





Too much to see in a day or a life,
so we pick and we choose
what fancies delights;
then, at the end, the cherubs alight.
