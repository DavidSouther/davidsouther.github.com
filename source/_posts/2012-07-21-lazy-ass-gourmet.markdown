### The art of cooking Fast, Cheap, Clean





Why aren't you cooking for yourself? Do you think it's too expensive? Do you think you don't know how to cook? Or do you just think you don't have enough time in the day? If any of those are your excuse, you're about to lose them. Cooking great food isn't that difficult once you have a few basic dishes, and with the right recipes, you can be cooking great dinners for yourself or your family in half an hour. This is lazy-ass gourmet, and we're going to cook the most fantastic meals in no time at all.

I'm a busy guy, but man, I love to cook. I've yet to find a restaurant that can consistently satisfy me with their cooking more than I can do on my own. My secret is finding recipes, and ways to cook those recipes, that take as long to cook as it takes me to watch an episode of the Daily Show (then I watch Colbert while I eat!). Here at lazy-ass gourmet, I'll share a bunch of these recipes, and ways to cook them so that we have a wide combination of things to do with our dishes that we'll always have great food at home, and never get bored with what we're eating.





This isn't [Broke-ass Gourmet](http://www.brokeassgourmet.com) (I absolutely recommend her recipes, they are fantastic), but you'll find that while the ingredients for a meal are about the same as a plate would be if you went out, you'll several plates worth, and it will definitely come out much cheaper in the long run. The ingredients I recommend are a step up from college dorm food, but you can have fun shopping around for the best prices on what you find are your favorite things. On the other hand, this isn't Iron Chef. I don't use that many ingredients, I just play with what I have in slightly different ways.





There are a lot of techniques in cooking. It takes some time to get comfortable with a knife. There are a lot of spices and flavors to discover and find out how they work together. These all take your time and experimentation, and frankly half the fun of cooking is trying new things, especially when they go wrong! These are things you really can't learn in a book (though you can make good headway), but just have to try on your own.





There is one thing, however, that I can tell you in the spirit of Lazy-Ass Gourmet. Clean up immediately. As in, before you go on to the next step, wipe off your utensils you just used and the surface you just used. It takes 10 seconds, but saves so much time from the daunting task of cleaning everything at once after you've cooked. Also, do things that make it easier to keep clean. When you're chopping and peeling onions, keep the trash can right there for the peelings. When you're working at the stove, put a splash guard over your pan and a lid on your pots. These little things make it a hundred times easier to keep your kitchen clean, and yourself happy and lazy.
