[Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) is a fantastic tool, something that nearly every javascript project will probably want to pull in at some point. Underscore is the collections framework for Javascript. It does all the collectiony things, in a functional way, very quickly and efficiently. There are still a couple other every-day things that JS libraries need, that don't quite touch the DOM, making jQuery a bit too heavy. To that end, I've put those features in a library called Superscore, a few additions to the underscore library. Many of these stand on their own, but since you should already be using underscore, it makes sense to namespace them there.

The project is available on [github](https://github.com/DavidSouther/superscore), along with all the [documentation](http://davidsouther.github.com/superscore/). Take a look and see if there's a place for it in your projects!
